                        <div class="ui message"><p>As children, Sam (Padalecki) and Dean Winchester's (Ackles) mother Mary (Samantha Smith) died a violent and unexplainable death, which in turn led their father, John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), to teach them hunting skills in search of the creature that took her life. Years later, while attending Stanford University, Sam is forced back into the paranormal world by Dean, who has come to tell him that their father is missing. The two travel to Jericho, California, to find him, but their search is put on hold when they discover that a ghostly Woman in White (Sarah Shahi)—the spirit of a woman who drowned her children and then killed herself—has been taking male victims. They investigate, but Dean is arrested for impersonating a federal agent. However, he manages to escape custody, and saves his brother from the vengeful spirit. The Woman in White is finally put to rest after the brothers force her to confront the spirits of her children. Sam later returns home but discovers his girlfriend Jessica (Adrianne Palicki) pinned to the ceiling. He is then forced to watch as she is killed in the same supernatural manner as his mother was. Jessica's death prompts him to return to the life of hunting with Dean.</p></div></div>

He and Sam manage to get the demon into the galley on-board, but it flees its host during the exorcism. Despite this, they continue the ritual, sending the demon back to Hell. Afterwards they get a surprise when the man who called them revealed he got their phone number from their father's voicemail. Though John doesn't answer when they call, they get their first indication that he's alive as his phone has been down since his disappearance.</p></div></div>

With the mirror now for sale in an antique store in the town, Bloody Mary has begun to target those nearby who secretly feel guilt over another's death. The brothers must find a way to stop her after a young girl (Marnette Patterson) inadvertently becomes her next target. They track down the original mirror and then smash it, but this only releases Bloody Mary.

The brothers escape and alert the police. Becky is saved, but the police believe Dean to be her attacker. As Dean later searches through the shape-shifter's lair, Sam visits Becky to make sure that she knows what they are dealing with. However, she reveals herself to be the shape-shifter and knocks Sam unconscious before morphing back into Dean. After the real Dean finds the real Becky tied up in the lair, he confronts the shape-shifter and shoots it dead while still in his form causing the police to declare Dean dead and end the manhunt for him.</p></div></div>

More attacks occur, with the victims seemingly connected to the girl. The brothers believe that the killer is the Hook Man, and research indicates that it is the vengeful spirit of Jacob Karns, a preacher who murdered 13 prostitutes in 1862 with the hook that replaced his lost hand and was later put to death for his crimes. Despite the man being buried in an unmarked grave, Dean manages to locate it and burn his bones, but it has no effect. To stop the spirit, they must destroy the hook, which was reforged into an unknown object by the church after Karns' death. In order to be sure, they burn everything silver in the church, but it doesn't stop the Hook Man. Lori and the brothers are confronted by the Hook Man. As they fight him, Sam realizes that Lori's cross necklace—given to her by her reverend father—is made of silver, and the spirit vanishes once it is burned.</p></div></div>

After doing research, they discover that a Native American tribe used to live in the area, but its members were murdered by cavalrymen, with the tribe's chief placing a curse on the land as he died. Sam and Dean determine that the curse will reach its climax that night, and race to warn the family living there as swarms of insects attack. They are able to fight off the bugs and survive through the night, and the insects leave at sunrise. The site is shut down temporarily as the boys discovered an unmarked Native American grave and the developer, whose family they saved from the bugs, decides to make sure it remains shut down.</p></div></div>

Though Missouri claims to have purified the house, Sam does not believe it was successful, so the brothers watch over the house. When the poltergeist returns, Sam's premonition starts to come true. The brothers rush in to rescue the family, but they themselves are saved by the spirit of their mother, who sacrifices herself to stop the poltergeist. Unknown to them, their father is at Missouri's house and though he dearly wants to see his children, he informs her that he can't until he knows the truth about something.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean receive a tip from their father, and travel to Rockford, Illinois, to investigate the haunted Roosevelt Asylum, where criminally insane patients rioted in 1964. One of the riot's victims was the chief psychiatrist (Norman Armour). The spirits there try to communicate rather than attack, leading the brothers to discover that the psychiatrist had been conducting cruel experiments on his patients like trepanation (it was implied that he was also practicing it due to diagrams in the background and the belief at the time it could relieve cranial pressure) and others in order to test his theory that provoking extreme anger would be therapeutic for them. The ghost of the doctor then confronts Sam, causing him to lose his sanity and try to kill his brother. Dean manages to subdue Sam and burn the doctor's corpse, stopping the spirit and returning Sam to normal. In the end, Sam answers Dean's cellphone to find their father calling them.</p></div></div>

However, instead of letting them help, he tells them to investigate the disappearances of young couples in rural Burkitsville, Indiana, Sam reveals to Dean that he would rather track down their father, prompting the two to angrily separate. As Sam meets a fellow hitchhiker named Meg Masters (Nicki Aycox), Dean starts the investigation and saves a traveling couple from a living scarecrow. Dean calls Sam about the creature, and discovers that a Vanir is being summoned in the form of a scarecrow to protect the town in exchange for annual sacrifices, with a sacred tree in the town giving it power. Because the couple intended for the ritual escaped, the townspeople choose Dean and Emily (Tania Saulnier) —a girl who lives in town with her aunt and uncle— to be the new sacrifices. However, Sam returns and rescues them, and the scarecrow instead takes Emily's aunt and uncle as its victims. The next morning, Emily and the brothers burn the sacred tree, and then leave town. Meanwhile, Meg hitches a ride on the highway, but slits the driver's throat, collecting his blood into a goblet and using it to communicate with an unknown being whom she calls father.</p></div></div>

Sam searches for a way to save him and believes he may have found an answer in a preacher who claims to heal the incurable (Kevin McNulty). At the congregation, Dean is chosen, and is cured of his condition. However, he and Sam soon learn that an openly gay teacher died of a heart attack at the same moment that Dean was healed. Further research reveals that deaths occurred in unison with other healings, prompting the brothers to believe that the preacher is using black magic to control a Reaper; healing people in exchange for the lives of those he deems immoral. However, they eventually discover that his wife (Rebecca Jenkins) is behind everything, and rush to destroy the altar used to control the Reaper. The preacher begins to "heal" Layla (Julie Benz), a young woman with a brain tumor, and the Reaper then goes after Dean. Sam destroys the altar, and the freed Reaper takes the wife's life, though the young woman is not healed. She later tells Dean that she has made peace with her coming death, and Dean promises to pray for her.</p></div></div>

The brothers eventually discover that Cassie's mother (Kathleen Noone), a white woman, left her boyfriend, Cyrus, for Cassie's African-American father. Cyrus tried to kill him out of anger, but he gained the upper hand and ended up beating Cyrus to death, dumping Cyrus' body and truck in a nearby swamp. The boys assume that Cyrus' spirit has returned and is out for revenge against everyone connected to his death. They attempt to put Cyrus to rest by burning his remains in rusted out truck in the swamp. However, the ghostly truck appears and attempts to run Dean down, and they realize that Cyrus' evil personality had infected the truck, and led it to take on a life of its own. The brothers end up defeating it by having Dean lead it in a chase and tricking it into driving onto the hallowed ground of an old, burned down church causing the hallowed ground to destroy it. Throughout the episode, Dean struggles to come to grips with his residual feelings for Cassie.</p></div></div>

When it soon appears that the house actually is haunted, the brothers head to Richardson, Texas, to investigate, and run into paranormal investigators Ed Zeddmore and Harry Spengler (A. J. Buckley and Travis Wester), owners of the website. Although their research shows no truth in the legend, the brothers nevertheless encounter the spirit, but it is different from what the legend describes. When Sam and Dean realize that the Mordechai's origins on Hell Hound's Lair has also changed, they theorize that the spirit is actually a Tulpa brought on by a Tibetan spirit sigil painted by the teens as a joke, with the beliefs of the website's visitors causing the story to become reality. The brothers trick Ed and Harry into posting a vulnerability for Mordechai onto their website, and later return to the house to kill him. However, Ed and Harry are also there, and reveal that the website's server crashed. With the Tulpa unaffected, Dean decides to burn the house down to stop the entity.</p></div></div>

Before she leaves, she taunts Dean about his father's deal, revealing that John is suffering in Hell.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>After Sam has a premonition of Dean killing a defenseless man, the brothers head to Rivergrove, Oregon to investigate. There, Sam notices "CROATOAN" carved into a pole, reminding him of the lost colony of Roanoke. They soon find that all forms of communication have been shut down, and extremely violent townspeople are blocking the roads out. They go to a local doctor's office, where a doctor finds that the blood of the violent people has been infected by a virus containing sulfur, leading Sam to believe his father's theory of Croatoan being a demonic plague. A woman in the office suddenly turns violent and attacks Sam. She infects him with her blood before Dean is able to kill her. Sam tries to kill himself, but Dean stops him. Moments later, it is learned that all of the infected people have suddenly vanished, leaving the town deserted. Sam has his blood tested, and finds out that he was not infected. After the brothers leave town, one of the survivors is revealed to be a demon; it contacts someone to inform him that Sam is immune to the virus, "as expected." After leaving, Dean pulls to the side of the road and finally starts to reveal to Sam what their father told him before dying.</p></div></div>

A distraught Sam forgives Dean for not telling him, but goes to the Roadhouse to try to find more psychic children like himself. Ash's search only finds a young man named Scott Carey, but he was murdered a month earlier. Sam heads to Lafayette, Indiana to investigate, and is followed by a young woman named Ava Wilson (Katharine Isabelle). Like Sam, she has premonitions, and foresaw Scott's death. She has also been having visions of Sam being killed in an explosion. The two steal Scott's file from a psychiatrist, and learn that he spoke to Azazel and was told about an army of psychic children being used in an upcoming war. The vampire hunter, Gordon Walker, who learned from a demon about Azazel's plans, then tries to kill Sam, but Dean stops him just in time, though ending up his prisoner. Sam remembers Ava's vision, and avoids explosive traps set by Gordon. He saves Dean, and police arrest Gordon due to an 'anonymous call' made by Sam. The brothers later go to check on Ava back in her hometown of Peoria, Illinois, but find her fiancé dead, with sulfur on the windowsill pointing to a demonic abduction.</p></div></div>

It is owned and run by Susan Thompson (Annie Wersching), a single mother who plans to sell it. Living there with her are her mother, Rose (Brenda McDonald), and her daughter, Tyler (Matreya Fedor), who has an imaginary friend named Maggie (Conchita Campbell). When another murder occurs while Sam and Dean are there, Sam feels guilty and, after getting drunk, makes Dean promise to kill him if he ends up turning evil. Later, the brothers discover that Rose has been practicing hoodoo, and suspect that she is behind the deaths. However, she recently suffered from a stroke, and would be unable to do so. Susan is soon attacked by a vengeful spirit, but is saved by Sam and Dean. They then discover that Maggie is the ghost of Rose's sister, Margaret, who drowned as a child in the inn's pool. Maggie had been kept at bay by Rose's practice of hoodoo, but has returned since Rose's stroke. Maggie does not want the family to move away, so she tries to drown Tyler so that she can have a friend forever. To save Tyler, Rose gives her own life, taking Tyler's place as Maggie's eternal playmate.</p></div></div>

A former security guard named Ronald "Ron" Reznick (Chris Gauthier) has been conducting his own research, and believes the culprit is a "mandroid"—half man, half machine. With his findings, the brothers instead realize that a shapeshifter is behind it all. Predicting that the next incident will occur at a bank, Sam and Dean pose as security workers to infiltrate the building, and eventually discover that the shapeshifter has taken the form of the bank's manager. However, before they can act, Ron arrives and takes everyone hostage. The brothers convince him that they believe his theory, and move everyone into the vault so that they can locate the shapeshifter. It has already morphed into another person, and when they discover its identity, it runs. Ron gives chase, but is then killed by a police sniper when he goes in front of a window. A hostage then has a heart attack, and Dean takes him to an ambulance outside the bank. He is identified, and FBI Agent Victor Henriksen (Charles Malik Whitfield) is called in. Henriksen reveals to Dean that he has been tracking him since the incident in St. Louis the previous year, when another shapeshifter framed Dean for attempted murder. Sam and Dean work to track the shapeshifter who repeatedly shifts form to avoid detection and avoid arrest by the police and FBI. Finally, Dean manages to kill the shapeshifter with a silver letter opener and he and Sam barely escape by disguising themselves as SWAT officers.</p></div></div>

Sam and Dean learn that a priest had been shot to death outside the church. While Sam wants to believe that it really is an angel, Dean thinks it is the vengeful spirit of the priest. Sam is later visited by the angel, who orders him to kill an evil man. While Dean tracks the angel's target to make sure that the man does not do anything bad, Sam summons the spirit of the priest (David Monahan). The spirit believes himself to be an angel, but another priest (Denis Arndt) at the church convinces him otherwise and puts his soul to rest using the Last Rites. Meanwhile, Dean prevents the man from attacking a woman, and then chases after him in his car. During the pursuit, the man almost crashes into a truck, and a metal pipe on the truck falls and impales him, which Dean believes may have been God's doing.</p></div></div>

He then track downs Jo at her job in Duluth, Minnesota, and begins to sadistically play mind games with her, but Dean arrives before he can physically hurt her. Sam again tries to convince Dean to shoot him, but Dean throws holy water on him, revealing a case of demonic possession. Sam shoots Dean and flees to the South Dakota home of fellow hunter Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver). However, Bobby tricks him into drinking holy water, and ties him up under a devil's trap. After Dean's wound is treated by Jo, he joins Bobby in an attempt to exorcise the demon. The ritual does not work, and Bobby learns that the demon used a binding ritual to bind itself to Sam's body. As the demon frees itself and attacks Dean, it reveals that it is the same demon which had formerly resided within Meg Masters, wanting revenge for their exorcising it. Bobby slashes the binding mark on Sam with a hot iron poker, and the demon is forced to flee though it is not sent back to Hell. To prevent further possession by the demon or any others, Bobby gives Sam and Dean charms to protect against possession and warns them to keep quiet about their role in the hunter's death.</p></div></div>

They confront the janitor (Richard Speight, Jr.) of the building near where the manifestations had occurred, who reveals his true identity.

She tries to show them the wreck, but the car has disappeared. While later driving to the police, they are confronted again by the man, but Dean drives through him, causing the ghost to dissipate. The brothers reveal that what has been chasing her is the vengeful spirit of Jonah Greeley (Winston Rekert), who died on that roadway years earlier and now kills drivers on the anniversary of his death. The trio locates Greeley's home nearby, and, after digging up his corpse, salt and burn the body. With the ghost of Greeley gone, the Winchesters explain to Molly that her husband is still alive, but is now married to someone else. Molly—having died in the same car accident that killed Greeley—is a spirit that has been reliving the same night since her death. Accepting the truth, she finally moves on.</p></div></div>

Though the brothers salt and burn her remains, another producer is killed. Sam then notices that the Latin used in the film's script is an actual summoning ritual. The writer, Martin Flagg (Michael B. Silver), tells them that the rituals are from the original script written by production assistant Walter Dixon (Benjamin Ratner). They confront Walter, who admits that he has been summoning spirits to get revenge against the people he believes ruined his script.

However, FBI Agent Henriksen shows up and attempts to extradite them. Their public defender, Mara Daniels (Bridget Ann White), believes that they may have been falsely accused of many crimes, but says that they can only stall extradition for a week. To create a distraction in order to allow Sam to destroy what they believe to be the spirit, Dean gets into a fight with a fellow prisoner. However, the vengeful spirit of a nurse attacks Dean in the infirmary proving they were wrong about the ghost's identity. He defends himself with salt, but she kills the other prisoner. Research reveals that it is Nurse Glockner, who used to kill infirmary patients and was later killed in a riot. She kills anyone who has committed a crime, regardless of how minor it is. Dean convinces Mara to locate where Glockner was buried, and the brothers decide to follow their escape plan. After getting into a fight with one another, they are taken away by a guard (Garwin Sanford)—Deacon. He helps them to escape. When Henriksen learns that Mara supplied the Winchesters with information, he forces her to tell him where she sent them. As the brothers dig up Glockner's body and then salt and burn her remains, the FBI arrive at the wrong cemetery, having been lied to by Mara. The Winchesters dispatch Glockner in time to save Deacon and realize they are in more trouble than ever before now.</p></div></div>

He and Sam were not brought up as hunters, and thus are no longer close. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him. When he realizes that all the people that he and Sam had saved as hunters are now dead, he decides that he must give up his new-found happiness to save them. Though Sam does not believe him, he accompanies his brother to the djinn's lair. There Dean discovers that the young woman he has been seeing is a victim of the creature. Noticing that she is alive but hallucinating —a way for the djinn to keep its victims captive while it feeds off their blood —Dean realizes that he, too, is within an illusory world. Despite his dream family trying to convince him to stay, Dean kills himself in the dream, waking himself in the real world where Sam rescues him. Sam and Dean battle the djinn and Dean kills it. They discover the other victim is still alive and take her to the hospital where she is expected to recover.</p></div></div>

As Dean and Bobby head to the Roadhouse for help and find it burned to the ground with the body of Ash buried in the wreckage, Andy uses his mind-control abilities to send Dean his location telepathically. That night, Sam is visited in a dream by Azazel, who explains that he has brought them together so that they can fight to the death, with the sole survivor becoming the leader of his army of demons. He reveals why he killed Sam's girlfriend, Jessica: she was in the way and shows Sam the source of the psychic children's abilities—his own demon blood. When he shows Sam the vision of the night of his mother's death, who Azazel explains he killed as she got in the way, Sam discovers to his shock that Mary recognized Azazel. Meanwhile, Ava uses a new demon-controlling ability and forces an Acheri demon to kill Lily and Andy. She then reveals to Sam that she has been in the town since she went missing, killing off other psychic children that Azazel has sent there. She sets the Acheri demon on him, but Jake sneaks up behind her and uses his superhuman strength to break her neck, causing the demon to flee. Jake attacks Sam as Azazel told him only one of them is getting out alive, but Sam gains the upper hand and apparently knocks him unconscious. However, as Sam is distracted by an arriving Dean and Bobby, Jake regains consciousness and fatally stabs him. Sam dies in Dean's arms.</p></div></div>

Ellen later arrives at Bobby's home, and gives them a map of Wyoming that Ash had left in the Roadhouse's safe. Research reveals that Samuel Colt—creator of the Colt gun—created a giant devil's trap using railway lines. At the trap's center is an old cowboy cemetery, which Azazel forces Jake to go to. The hunters are there to meet him, but Jake subdues them long enough to use the Colt as a key to open a mausoleum. Sam then shoots Jake in the back, and finishes him off with multiple shots as he begs for mercy. As the mausoleum doors begin to open, they realize that it is a Devil's Gate —a doorway to Hell. A rush of demons escape and break the iron railway lines of the devil's trap, allowing Azazel to enter. As Ellen and Bobby try to close the gateway, Sam and Dean take the Colt to confront Azazel. Unfortunately, the demon catches them by surprise and takes the gun. He taunts Dean's demonic pact and questions if what came back was "one hundred percent pure Sam". Azazel prepares to kill them, but the escaped spirit of John Winchester grabs him. This distraction allows Dean to take back the Colt and shoot the demon in the heart, finally killing him. As Bobby and Ellen manage to close the gates, John's spirit moves on. However, while Azazel is now dead, hundreds of other demons escaped, an army's worth and their work is not done yet. Sam also promises to find a way to save Dean after he admits to him about his deal.</p></div></div>

With only a year left to live—he made a demonic pact to resurrect Sam—Dean decides to live life to the fullest and exhibits a carefree attitude that troubles Sam, who is trying to find a loophole. Friend and fellow hunter Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) informs the brothers about a supernatural sighting in Nebraska, which turns out to be demonic manifestations of the Seven Deadly Sins. While investigating, they meet Isaac (Peter Macon) and Tamara (Caroline Chikezie), a husband and wife team of hunters. Isaac and Tamara trail one of the demons to a bar, but discover that all the patrons are demonically possessed. The two are restrained, and Isaac dies after being forced to drink drain cleaner. Before the demons can target Tamara, Bobby and the Winchesters crash their car into the building. They throw the personification of Envy into the trunk, and drive away with Tamara. The hunters interrogate the demon and then exorcise it. Later that night, the other Sins track them down. During the scuffle, a mysterious blonde named Ruby (Katie Cassidy) saves Sam and kills three demons with a magical knife—demons are typically immune to physical harm—before departing. The rest of the Sins are exorcised. As Sam continues his research the next day, Dean reveals that a clause in his pact will end Sam's life if he tries to escape the deal.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Dean reads about a death in Cicero, Indiana, where a man was pushed onto a power saw. The town reminds him of Lisa Braeden (Cindy Sampson), a woman he knew eight years prior and whom he wants to see again before he dies. Later arriving in Cicero, Dean drops Sam off at a motel and drives to her house. He arrives during her son Ben's (Nicholas Elia) eighth birthday party, leading Dean to suspect that he is Ben's father. Lisa denies this, and tells Dean about the saw accident. Meanwhile, Ruby visits Sam at a diner. She surprises him with her knowledge of his psychic abilities, and informs him that something happened to all of his mother's friends. She also tells him that there is a supernatural occurrence in town. Moments later, Dean calls Sam and reveals that four other "accidents" occurred in Lisa's neighborhood. As Dean helps Ben deal with bullies, Sam investigates one of the accidents—a man fell off a ladder—and notices the child is behaving oddly. A mark on the mother's neck also catches his attention. Later, Sam researches changelings. He suspects that the creatures have replaced the local children, killed the fathers, and are feeding on the mothers. The brothers discover the mother changeling is using a vacant house as her base. Inside, they find a recently-replaced Ben, the other children, and the local realtor in cages. The mother changeling, in the form of the realtor, attacks them. Sam retaliates with a flamethrower, and all the changelings explode in flames upon her death. The real children are returned, and Dean explains everything to Lisa. Dean reluctantly turns down an offer to stay, telling her that it is not his life. Elsewhere, Sam confirms to Ruby that all of his mother's friends were killed. She reveals herself as a demon, but claims that she wants to help him.</p></div></div>

Elsewhere, the brothers are alerted to a break-in at one of their father's storage rooms in Buffalo, New York, where thieves have stolen a rabbit's foot. Sam and Dean use security footage to track them down and retrieve the item. However, Bobby informs them that the foot is cursed. Anyone who touches it—Sam already has—is granted good luck, but will die within a week if the foot is lost. As Bobby researches a method to destroy it, Sam begins having good luck. Later, however, a waitress spills coffee on Sam to distract him and steals the foot. When Sam begins to have bad luck, they interrogate one of the thieves—the other who touched the foot has since died—and they learn about the woman who hired them, Bela Talbot (Lauren Cohan). Bobby knows of her and how she steals supernatural items for profit, and gives them a lead on her location. Dean retrieves the foot from Bela's flat in Queens, but Sam's bad luck helps Kubrick and another hunter track him down. They prepare to kill Sam, but Dean arrives in time and uses the good luck of the rabbit's foot to incapacitate them with a pen and TV remote. Bobby finds a ritual to break the curse, but Bela interrupts before its completion. She demands the foot, and shoots Sam in the shoulder to display her ruthlessness. Dean tricks her into becoming cursed, forcing her to allow the foot's destruction. However, she gets the last laugh as she stole winning lottery tickets Dean got with the foot. Kubrick later visits Gordon in prison again. Believing the coincidences that helped him to locate Sam were caused by God, he agrees to help Gordon break out of prison.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Omens and two unusual deaths lead the brothers to Elizabethville, Ohio, a once-sleepy town that has been turned into a haven for gamblers and drinkers. They first speak with Father Gil (Robert Curtis Brown), who witnessed a suicide in his church. A fellow hunter named Richie then takes them to a local bar to investigate its owner Trotter. A fight breaks out between two patrons, and the bartender Casey (Sasha Barrese) uses the distraction to lure away Richie. She takes him to a home owned by her parents, and kills him in the basement. Elsewhere, Ruby helps Bobby repair the Colt—a mystical gun capable of killing anything. As Sam tests Trotter and discovers that he is not possessed, Dean searches for Richie. He locates the demonic Casey, and tricks her into stepping inside a devil's trap—mystical symbols capable of rendering one powerless—in the basement. Dean begins an exorcism, but Casey destroys the book and telekinetically causes the basement entrance to cave in. Now trapped together, Dean and Casey begin a conversation. Though the demons encouraged Trotter to bring gambling and prostitution to the town, the citizens' behavior is merely human nature. She also reveals that her world is in disarray following the demon Azazel's death and Sam's failure to replace him as leader. The two continue their discussion, and Casey begins developing respect for Dean. Meanwhile, Sam is unable to locate Dean or Casey, and enlists the help of Father Gil. He leads Sam to Casey just as Bobby arrives. Father Gil reveals himself to be a demon and incapacitates them. He breaks into the basement and frees his lover Casey. Despite her pleas, Father Gil sets his sights onto Dean. Sam intervenes and kills both demons with the Colt worrying Dean with his ruthlessness due to Azazel's warning about Sam possibly not coming back "one hundred percent pure Sam."</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean travel to Maple Springs, New York to investigate a deadly attack against three brothers. Though they believe a werewolf to be the culprit, the lone survivor claims the attacker was a normal man. Over time, the Winchesters realize that fairy tales appear to be occurring within the town—the attack was based on Three Little Pigs—and are being controlled by the spirit of a young girl. Research on any local deaths of a young girl turn up nothing, but the brothers do find a comatose girl named Callie (Ava Rebecca Hughes) at the hospital. Her father, Dr. Garrison (Christopher Cousins), has been reading her fairy tales. Sam and Dean believe that she was poisoned with bleach by her step-mother, and has been bringing fairy tales to life in an attempt to get attention. Meanwhile, an old woman is brought into the hospital. In the style of Little Red Riding Hood, her granddaughter has been kidnapped. As Dean tracks down the girl but is attacked by the kidnapper, Sam explains the situation to Dr. Garrison. He cannot believe that his wife would do such a thing, but Callie's spirit appears and confirms Sam's claims. Callie then peacefully dies, and her spirit moves on. Elsewhere, the kidnapper is freed from Callie's control. Later that night, Sam gives the Crossroads Demon (Sandra McCoy) with whom Dean made the pact an ultimatum—either release Dean from his bargain or die. The demon says that only her boss has the power to break the deal. When she refuses to reveal her boss' name, Sam shoots her dead.</p></div></div>

Sam and Dean question the woman's aunt Gertrude (Ellen Geer), who knows about the ghost ship and asks them if they are working with a woman named Alex. After the brothers leave, they are confronted by Bela. Using the pseudonym of "Alex", she "solved" the case for Gertrude, who has withheld payment since the Winchesters arrived. More deaths occur that night, and the brothers realize that the ship is a death omen linked to the spirit of a sailor hanged for treason. The sailor's hand was crafted in a Hand of Glory. Bela suggests that they destroy it to stop the ghost ship. Using tickets provided by Gertrude, the trio attends a lavish function at the local Maritime Museum. Bela steals the hand, but sneaks away from the brothers. She sells the hand to a client—her goal all along—but then sees the ghost ship. With her death imminent, Bela turns to the Winchesters for help. They have discovered that the spirit only targets people responsible for the deaths of family members, which Bela will not elaborate on. The three of them conduct a summoning ritual at the sailor's grave. The vengeful spirit is confronted by the captain who ordered his death—his brother—and both disappear.</p></div></div>

She rebukes his threats to kill her unless she reveals the location of the brothers, but eventually acquiesces in exchange for a priceless mojo bag. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean capture and interrogate the vampire Lucy (Mercedes McNab), and learn that another vampire named Dixon (Matthew Humphreys) transformed her by spiking her drink with his own blood at a club in Albany, New York. Dean is forced to kill Lucy, as there is no known cure for vampirism. The brothers locate and confront Dixon, but are interrupted by Gordon and Kubrick. Sam and Dean escape, but in the mayhem, Dixon kidnaps Gordon. Though Dixon had planned on using Gordon as food, the hunter's continuous taunting prompts him to feed him his blood. When the brothers—having been informed by Bela of Gordon's location, which she discovered via Ouija board—arrive at Dixon's hideout, they discover that the vampiric Gordon has escaped. Elsewhere, Gordon returns to Kubrick, but kills him in self-defense. As night approaches, the brothers have not been able to find Gordon. Dean decides to go after Gordon while Sam stays hidden, but Sam refuses. He then confronts Dean about his reckless behavior since his deal; Dean relents and agrees to behave more like his old self again. Gordon later calls Sam and Dean, threatening to kill a young woman if they do not meet him. They head to the location and find the woman, but Gordon uses a rollerdoor to separate the brothers. The woman is revealed to be a vampire turned by Gordon. While Dean is forced to shoot her with the Colt, Sam decapitates Gordon with a razor wire. The brothers later stop on the side of the road to check a rattling noise made by the Impala, and Dean begins teaching Sam how to repair the car since his time is running out.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>
When a being dressed as Santa Claus begins killing people after dragging them up the chimney, the Winchesters head to Ypsilanti, Michigan to investigate. Sam suspects that an evil version of Santa—many world lores tell of those who punish the wicked during Christmas—is at work. He notices that over both victims' fireplaces are the same wreaths made of meadowsweet, a herb often used in pagan rituals to lure gods to a human sacrifice. The brothers track down the makers of the wreaths, a pair of pagan gods posing as the apparently perfect Edward (Spencer Garrett) and Madge Carrigan (Merrilyn Gann). However, they are captured as intended human sacrifices. When the Carrigans are distracted by a neighbor at the front door, the Winchesters break free. Knowing that the gods can be killed by evergreen wood, they stab the gods to death with branches of the Christmas tree.
Throughout the episode, the brothers debate celebrating Christmas after having skipped the tradition for years. Dean wants to celebrate because it will be his last chance, while Sam does not for the same reason. Flashbacks accompany this, depicting a young Sam (Colin Ford) and Dean (Ridge Canipe) on Christmas Eve of 1991. With their father out on a hunt, the brothers are staying alone in a motel room until he returns. Sam, having read his father's hunting journal, is finally told the truth by Dean about what their father does. Later that night, Dean steals gifts from a nearby house to make it look like their father dropped off presents. Knowing the truth but appreciating what Dean tried to do for him, Sam gives him the gift meant for their father—the amulet necklace that Dean has worn ever since. As the episode ends in the present, Dean is surprised to find that Sam has decorated their motel room with Christmas paraphernalia, now wanting to celebrate with him.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean investigate a series of witchcraft-related deaths in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, and believe that the neighborhood book club is actually a coven. Ruby shows up and warns them that a powerful force is controlling the witches. The force will likely target Sam, so Ruby advises him to leave town. The brothers ignore her pleas and head back to their motel. Dean confronts Sam about his lack of concern over killing people, so Sam explains that he is just trying to be more like him in order to prepare himself to fight alone in the upcoming demon war. Intense pain suddenly overcomes Dean, who is being attacked through magic. Sam is unable to find the hex bag—a small bag of various ingredients that witches use to focus their magic onto a target—and instead decides to go after the witches with the Colt. Ruby arrives shortly after and is able to save Dean from the spell with a potion. Elsewhere, the three women deny targeting Dean, and claim that they have only used witchcraft for personal gain. Sam realizes that Tammi (Marisa Ramirez), who has not benefited from the coven, is what Ruby warned him about. Tammi incapacitates Sam and kills one of the women. She stops a bullet from the Colt in mid-air with telekinesis, and subdues Dean when he attacks. Ruby tries to trick Tammi by claiming she led the Winchesters right to her, but fails in her attempt to kill the powerful demon. The other witch begins reciting a spell. Tammi quickly kills her, but the distraction gives Dean enough time to stab Tammi with Ruby's knife. Later that night, Ruby admits to Dean that she cannot save him from his deal. She also reveals that all demons were once humans, but have had their humanity stripped away in Hell. Like the coven, she was also a witch who sold her soul to Tammi, but for some reason still remembers what it is like to be human. Ruby requests Dean's help in preparing Sam for the future.</p></div></div>

Trapped within a nightmare, Bobby is hiding from a mysterious woman (Elizabeth Marleau) in his home. The brothers search Bobby's motel room and find a newspaper article about a doctor who suffered a sleep-related death. Dean tracks down Jeremy, a young man who was part of a secret sleep study conducted by the doctor. Unable to dream after being brutally hit in the head with a baseball bat by his father, Jeremy (G. Michael Gray) reveals that the experiment allowed him to do so by drinking a yellow tea, but the dreams scared him so much that he dropped out of the study. Sam later explains that a plant known as "African Dream Root" allows a person to enter and manipulate others' dreams; he believes someone killed the doctor in this manner and is now targeting Bobby. Acquiring the dream root from Bela, Sam and Dean rescue Bobby from his demonically-possessed wife whom he was forced to kill years earlier. Sam is attacked by Jeremy in the dream, but they all awaken when Bobby takes control. Sam and Dean later use the dream root to confront Jeremy, but become separated. Dean first sees Lisa declaring her love for him, and is then faced by a demonic version of himself that comments on his feelings of worthlessness. The Dream Dean taunts him that he cannot escape his fate, and reminds him that exposure to Hell will transform him into a demon. As Dean begins to fight his doppelganger, Sam finds Jeremy and summons a dream version of Jeremy's father. A terrified Jeremy is distracted, and Sam kills him with a baseball bat. The brothers awaken from their dreams, only to find that Bela has stolen the Colt from them. As the brothers prepare to leave to hunt her down, Dean admits that he does not want to die.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam awakens in his motel room Tuesday morning to Asia's "Heat of the Moment", and finds Dean already up and getting dressed. During breakfast, they discuss the disappearance of a man at the Mystery Spot in Broward County, Florida. That night, they break into the attraction, but are confronted by the owner who inadvertently kills Dean with his shotgun. To Sam's surprise, he sees Dean when he wakes up the next morning, once again getting dressed and lip-syncing to "Heat of the Moment". The day appears to be repeating itself, so Sam suggests they visit the Mystery Spot during the day. As Dean agrees, he is killed by a speeding car. The time loop continues, with Dean's getting killed in various ways despite Sam's attempts to circumvent it. One hundred Tuesdays later, an agitated Sam notices that the man at the diner is using a different syrup than before. He confronts the man, who reveals himself as the Trickster (Richard Speight, Jr.): a demi-god who enjoys playing fatal pranks on the pompous (he previously dealt with the Winchesters in an episode at a college campus). The Trickster admits to starting the time loop to convince Sam that he cannot save Dean, but offers to return time to normal. When Sam still tries to kill him, the Trickster snaps his fingers and initiates the next morning (Wednesday). The Winchesters decide to leave town, but Dean is gunned down in an attempted mugging. With the time loop broken, Dean remains dead. Months pass, and a distant Sam has become a lone hunter in his search for the Trickster. He ignores Bobby's numerous calls, but eventually hears a message claiming that he has located the Trickster. The two hunters reunite at the Mystery Spot, where Bobby prepares a summoning ritual. Realizing the truth, Sam stabs Bobby in the heart with a wooden stake in an attempt to kill the Trickster, however it is but an illusion as the real Trickster appears. Sam begs that Dean be brought back to life and they would not hunt the Trickster anymore. The Trickster points out that Dean is his weakness; both brothers are always willing to sacrifice themselves for one another, and their enemies know it. He restores the timeline to Wednesday with both Dean and Sam intact.</p></div></div>

Police quickly storm the room and take them into custody. FBI Deputy Director Steven Groves (Peter DeLuise) arrives at the sheriff's station to prepare for the brothers' extradition, but reveals himself as a demon when he is alone with them. He shoots Dean in the shoulder, but then flees his host after Sam initiates an exorcism. The FBI agents who came to extradite the Winchesters are discovered to have been killed, and their helicopter explodes. A demonically-possessed Henriksen kills the sheriff, but the brothers then perform an exorcism. Henriksen now realizes that the brothers have been telling the truth about what they do, and releases them from their cell. Using their expertise, the brothers protect the station against demons with devil's traps and salt barriers. A horde of demons take control of the local population, and surrounds the station. Ruby appears in the station—she found a break in one of the salt lines—and warns them that demons are now following Lilith, a powerful new leader who wants Sam dead. Ruby proposes a spell to safely kill the demons, but Dean declines the offer because it involves sacrificing both herself and the virgin secretary Nancy Fitzgerald (Aimee Garcia). After Ruby departs, they allow the demons inside. A recording of Sam reciting an exorcism plays through the PA system. One demon escapes before his comrades are exorcised. Henriksen promises the Winchesters that he will cover up what occurred and will report them as having been killed in the helicopter explosion. Shortly after the brothers leave, a little girl enters the sheriff's office and asks for the Winchesters. Revealing herself to be Lilith, she destroys the station in a blast of white energy. Ruby reveals this to the Winchesters and gives them hex bags to hide themselves from demons.</p></div></div>

J. Buckley). They are shooting the pilot for their reality show Ghostfacers along with Ed's adopted sister Maggie, gay intern Corbett (Dustin Milligan), and cameraman Spruce (Austin Basis). According to legend, the spirit of Freeman Daggett returns every leap year to bring more victims to the house. The group comes across a ghost reliving his death, which the Winchesters call a harmless "death echo". Corbett soon disappears, and the rest are unable to escape before midnight; the spirit locks down the house, trapping its inhabitants. In their search for Corbett, they come across the home office of Daggett. The janitor of the local hospital, he used to bring home corpses from the morgue to "play" with. Sam suddenly vanishes and finds himself with Corbett, both tied to chairs at a birthday-party setup. The spirit appears and kills Corbett, then places a party hat onto Sam's head. As Dean enters the bomb shelter holding Sam, the others place themselves in a circle of salt—a ghost deterrent—and watch a death echo of Corbett. Ed, who Corbett was in love with, talks Corbett out of the death echo. His spirit confronts Daggett, putting him to rest. Before departing the next day, Sam and Dean wipe all of the Ghostfacers footage with an electromagnet.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>After repeatedly getting phone calls from a mysterious woman, even after ripping the phone line from the wall, a man shoots himself in the head. The Winchesters head to Milan, Ohio to speak to his wife during their investigation, and deduce that the caller was a woman named Linda who died in a car accident with the man. At the phone company, Sam and Dean meet with the manager, Clark Adams (Tom O'Brien). He introduces them to a technician named Stewie Meyers, who tracks the number and reveals it has called ten houses over a two-week period. Visits to some of the homes reveal that people have been receiving calls from dead loved ones. Dean then receives a call from his father (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who claims that the demon holding his contract is in town and later gives him the location. Sam does not believe it to be their father, and his doubts are confirmed when a girl named Lanie (Cherilyn Wilson) is encouraged to commit suicide by calls from her dead mother. Lanie's brother has also been receiving the calls, and Sam saves him when he purposefully steps into oncoming traffic. Sam then calls Dean and explains they are facing a Crocotta. The monster has been convincing people to kill themselves so that he can devour their souls. Believing Stewie to be the Crocotta, Sam confronts him at the phone company. However, Clark reveals himself as the monster and consumes Stewie's soul. Sam realizes that Clark imitated Dean on the phone, and that the real Dean is still waiting for the demon to arrive. Clark calls another man, pretending to be his dead daughter and claiming that her killer is at the house Dean is waiting in. As Sam manages to kill the Crocotta, the man attacks Dean but is overpowered. Figuring out that the man is not a demon due to him being immune to a devil's trap, Dean stops attacking and convinces him that he is not his daughter's killer. Dean then finally accepts that he can't expect for some miraculous way to come to save him, he has to do it himself.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam convinces Dean to go to Erie, Pennsylvania, to investigate a possible zombie, but they instead learn that the culprit behind recent organ thefts is Doc Benton (Billy Drago). Having abandoned his work in 1816 to follow his obsession of finding the key to eternal life, he drugs people and harvests their internal organs to replace his. Sam wants to use Doc Benton's research to find a way to extend Dean's life. Dean instead leaves for Canaan, Vermont, to speak with retired hunter Rufus Turner (Steven Williams), whom Bobby claims knows of both Bela's location and background. When he confronts her, she claims that the Colt has already been sold. He angrily reveals his knowledge of her parents—she had their car brakes cut due to abuse from her father—but then realizes that she had made a demonic pact. Like himself, her time is running out. He peacefully departs. Meanwhile, Sam rescues a woman from Doc Benton in an isolated cabin, stealing his research journal in the process. His survival methods are purely scientific, and are thus of no use to saving Dean. Doc Benton later kidnaps Sam and tries to harvest his eyes, but is stopped by Dean. With the doctor apparently immortal, the brothers bury him alive. Running out of time, Bela breaks into their motel room and shoots at their beds, which are revealed to be empty. They had expected her betrayal again and left town already. Dean calls Bela, and she explains that the Colt and Sam's death were the only way out of her deal. She also reveals that Lilith holds all of the deals; if Dean kills her, he may be able to break his. Dean hangs up, and Bela is left staring off into the distance as the growls of a hellhound—vicious, dog-like monsters who hunt down those whose contracts have expired—are heard.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>With only 30 hours left until Dean's contract ends, Bobby tracks Lilith to New Harmony, Indiana. Dean does not want to attack unprepared, but refuses to seek help from Ruby due to her ambiguous nature. Sam nevertheless secretly summons her and requests her demon-killing knife. Ruby claims that Sam's dormant psychic abilities can easily kill Lilith, who is on "shore leave" and has her guard down. Sam considers the alternative, but Dean shows up and tricks Ruby into a devil's trap. The brothers take her knife and leave. Despite Dean's rebukes, Bobby insists that he go with them and points out Dean's hallucinations. With his demise approaching rapidly, Dean has begun "piercing the veil", allowing him to glimpse the true forms of demons. When the trio arrives in New Harmony, they find that Lilith is possessing a young girl (Sierra McCormick) and terrorizing her family. As Bobby blesses a waterline running to the sprinklers of Lilith's house, Sam and Dean dispatch some of the demons who have taken over the neighborhood. Ruby appears and angrily confronts them, but is stopped short by an oncoming horde of demons. The three of them run into the house as Bobby activates the sprinklers, creating a barrier of holy water. Sam finds the little girl sleeping and prepares to strike, but is stopped by Dean, who reveals that Lilith is no longer inside her. As midnight approaches, Dean realizes that Lilith has taken over Ruby's host. Claiming to have sent Ruby "far, far away", Lilith telekinetically pins the brothers down as her hellhound mauls Dean to death. Lilith then blasts Sam with white energy from her hand. Horrified to see that it has no effect, she flees her host before Sam can retaliate. A devastated Sam cradles Dean, whose soul is then shown in Hell hanging from a vast landscape of chains and meathooks.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Four months after he was ripped apart and his soul dragged to Hell by a hellhound, Dean Winchester inexplicably wakes up underground in a coffin, completely whole and intact save for a burn in the shape of a hand-print on his biceps. He manages to escape his coffin, but is ambushed by an unknown entity that manifests as a light that shatters glass and hurts Dean's ears when it tries to speak to him. Believing that Sam made a deal with a demon to bring him back, he tracks Sam down near where he had been buried, but Sam is just as surprised at Dean's resurrection as he himself, having tried and failed to bring Dean back. It is later revealed to the audience that Sam's psychic abilities have advanced greatly, as he is now able to exorcise demons with them. It is also revealed that he is now intimately involved with the Winchesters' shady demon ally Ruby (Genevieve Cortese), who has returned from wherever Lilith sent her in their last confrontation. Sam and Dean's friend Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) brings the Winchesters to a psychic named Pamela Barnes (Traci Dinwiddie) for help in discovering what pulled Dean out of Hell. Pamela does find out the name of the being Castiel, but the sight of Castiel burns her eyes out, resulting in her becoming permanently blind, when she disregards his warnings and tries to look at him. Sick of being toyed with, Dean decides to summon the thing together with Bobby while Sam is away (having his own secret rendezvous with Ruby) in order to find out what it wants, and they perform a ritual to summon it. Castiel (Misha Collins) appears, revealing himself to be an angel, not a demon, to a skeptical Dean. He explains that he is responsible for dragging Dean out of Hell and, when Dean asks why he of all people would be worthy of being saved, that God has work for him to do.</p></div></div>

Sam is haunted by FBI Agent Henrickson who died in the explosion caused by Lilith; the ghost accuses Sam of failing him. Together with Bobby, they find out that they're being haunted by the spirits of the people they couldn't save, which is called "The Rising of the Witnesses," a sign of the upcoming Apocalypse. Meg Masters (Nicki Aycox) and two twin girls also appear and haunt Dean, Sam, and Bobby. The three find a spell to put the Witnesses to rest, but have to leave the panic room they are hiding in to do it. As Sam and Dean hold off the spirits, Bobby performs the spell, but Meg tries to kill him. Dean manages to complete the spell and the Witnesses are put to rest. Later, Castiel appears to Dean in a dream and reveals that "The Rising of the Witnesses" is one of many seals, which are being broken by Lilith in order to bring on the Apocalypse, in which Lucifer the fallen angel will walk the earth free.</p></div></div>

Castiel appears beside Dean's bed to transport Dean back in time to 1973 in Lawrence, Kansas with the cryptic warning that he must "stop it." There, Dean meets a younger John Winchester (Matt Cohen) and Mary Campbell (Amy Gumenick). The family reunion gets bigger when Dean meets his and Sam's maternal grandparents, Samuel (Mitch Pileggi) and Deanna Campbell (Allison Hossack), who are hunters who have brought Mary up in the life, thus making Mary a hunter as well. However, there is even more to this than Dean had imagined, as Mary had made a desperate deal with Azazel that resulted in his appearance the night she died. Dean also finds out that Azazel had fed Sam his blood that night as part of a plan that Azazel hints is even bigger than previously thought. Dean fails to kill Azazel or save his family, and when Castiel returns him to his rightful time, he admits that there was no changing that because it was meant to happen. Castiel and the angels only wanted Dean to find out what Azazel was up to for himself. Castiel then sends Dean to find Sam, warning him to stop Sam from going down the dark path he is on, or Castiel will, indicating that he will kill Sam if necessary.</p></div></div>

Distance and tension is put between the two brothers as Dean realizes that Sam is tapping into the demonic blood inside him with Ruby's help and lying to him about it. Sam argues that he is able to save people and exorcise demons at the same time, but Dean reveals to Sam what Castiel had said. A hunter who has known the Winchesters for years calls on Sam and Dean for help in a case in Carthage, Missouri involving a man who is going through a metamorphosis into a Rugaru—a monstrous creature that consumes human flesh. During the hunt, Sam lashes out on Dean, saying he is tired of how Dean looks at him like a freak. Tension mounts between them even further as they disagree on how to deal with the man, with Sam advocating that they try reasoning with him so that he can try to control himself and Dean believing that the man can't help but give into his monstrous nature. Despite attempting to prevent it, the man completes his transformation when Sam and Dean's friend tries to kill both him and his pregnant wife and he can't overcome his instincts anymore. He kills the hunter, but retains enough control to spare his wife. When the man tries to kill Dean, Sam is forced to kill him by burning him alive. Seeing what the man went through, Sam decides to stop using his powers.</p></div></div>

They soon discover this is the work of a shapeshifter (Todd Stashwick) obsessed with monster movies. The shapeshifter has become infatuated with the local bartender Jamie (Melinda Sward) whom it got close to in an alternate identity as a friend and co-worker (Holly Dignard). Jealous of Dean's budding romance with Jamie, it captures them both with plans to kill Dean and make Jamie its bride. Sam finds and frees Dean and while they battle the shapeshifter (Stashwick), Jamie kills it by shooting it with Sam's silver-loaded gun, which it deems a fitting end to its own "movie." The next day, Dean and Jamie part with a kiss, and the episode closes out on Sam guessing which movie Dean would like to live in.</p></div></div>

They determine that the man died of a ghost sickness, which is passed onto Dean. The illness causes a person to experience general anxiety that builds into deadly fear. Sam contacts Bobby and finds out from him that the ghost they're after is called a Buruburu. Sam and Bobby must find a way to save Dean before his heart stops which is made harder as the ghost has no body to burn. As Dean is being tormented by hallucinations of Lilith (Sierra McCormick) that reveal that he does remember Hell, Sam and Bobby decide to scare the ghost to death. They wrap an iron chain inscribed with spellwork around his neck and Bobby then roadhauls him behind the Impala, re-enacting his death and successfully scaring the ghost to death. The ghost is destroyed just in time to save Dean, whose heart had come dangerously close to stopping.</p></div></div>

The brothers find hex bags and deduce that a witch is sacrificing people to summon a dangerous demon named Samhain. Castiel arrives in town and tells Sam and Dean that the freeing of Samhain is one of the seals that will lead to freeing Lucifer. To protect the seal by killing the witch, Castiel brings a specialist angel named Uriel (Robert Wisdom) to smite the entire town to be sure of killing the witch, but is convinced by Dean not to and to give the Winchesters a chance to stop the witch. Samhain is freed despite their best efforts and after Ruby's knife is knocked out of his hands, Sam is forced to use his powers to exorcise the demon, stopping the rise of the ghosts and demons he was causing; however, the seal is still broken. Uriel warns Sam against using his demonic powers and says that he will kill Sam as soon as Sam ceases to be useful to the angels. Still annoyed by Dean stopping him from smiting the town, Uriel tells Sam to ask Dean what he remembers from Hell, implying that Dean does, in fact, remember what happened to him there. Meanwhile, Castiel reveals to Dean that his true orders were always to follow Dean's orders to test his leadership under battlefield conditions, though even he does not know if Dean passed the test. He confesses that he does not know what the "right" choice would be and that he has his own doubts, though he does not show them. Lastly, Castiel warns that hard times are ahead and says that he doesn't envy Dean for what is to come.</p></div></div>

The boys find that the origin is a magic coin that causes a fountain to become a wishing well, being that the coin's power is drawn from the pagan goddess Tiamat. The only way to reverse the wishes is for the person who put the coin there to remove it. It turns out to be the geek and he is reluctant to do so, but after one of the wishes results in Sam's death, he removes the coin, reversing all the wishes. Sam melts the coin down. At the same time, Dean helps the kid who was bullied keep up his new image of strength to prevent bullying in the future. With Sam having asked about what Uriel had meant by what Dean remembers of Hell, Dean finally admits to Sam that he does remember everything that happened in Hell, but refuses to tell him anything else, as Sam wouldn't be able to understand.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Ruby returns to give Sam and Dean a lead: other demons are searching for an escaped mental patient named Anna Milton (Julie McNiven), who was locked up after she went into hysterics because she heard angels talking in her head about the upcoming Apocalypse and needed to be restrained after trying to warn people. Sam and Dean investigate and find that Ruby was telling the truth and that Anna's claims about the Apocalypse are uncannily accurate. After finding her parents dead at her home, Sam and Dean track Anna to her father's church, where Ruby arrives to warn them that one of the "heavy-hitter" demons looking for Anna has been following them since Anna's house. They are unable to escape before the demon attacks them. It is then revealed that the new demon, whose name is Alastair (Mark Rolston), knows Dean from his time in Hell. While Alastair takes Sam out and beats on Dean, Ruby escapes with Anna. Sam recovers and stabs Alastair with Ruby's knife; while it doesn't kill him, it gives the Winchesters the chance to flee to safety. Believing they were set up by Ruby, Dean lashes out at Sam for trusting her, so Sam tells him what happened during the months Dean was in Hell. Sam's account is depicted in flashbacks; the flashbacks show him encountered Ruby (Anna Williams) again for the first time since Dean's death, while drunk and trying in vain to bring Dean back. Though Ruby had been tortured and eventually released from Hell by Lilith only on the condition that she kill Sam, she had only agreed to it to trick Lilith into setting her free, as she still wanted to help Sam. However, Sam rejected her because she couldn't save Dean from Hell, and demanded that she leave her host body to spare the host. Ruby acquiesced and possessed the body of a brain-dead coma patient (Cortese) whose life support had just been cut so that she would not be usurping someone else's life. She then returned to Sam and he agreed to let her teach him how to use his powers to kill Lilith and avenge Dean. In the meantime, she made him quit drinking and provided him with some physical comfort when she seduced him. She finally earned his trust when she came after him and saved him from a trap Lilith had prepared for him, even though he had threatened to kill her if she tried to intervene. After the last flashback, Ruby briefly takes a different host (Michelle-Hewitt Williams) to find the Winchesters and give them Anna's location. There, Dean extends an olive branch of sorts to Ruby (Cortese) due to his appreciation of how she helped Sam in his absence, and Sam is forced to break the news to a devastated Anna that her parents are dead. The episode ends on a cliffhanger, with Castiel and Uriel appearing and demanding to be taken to Anna so that they can kill her.</p></div></div>

Wanting answers, Dean and Sam call upon Pamela, who uses hypnosis on Anna to unlock her memories of her mysterious early years. Doing so restores Anna's memories of what she truly is: a fallen angel who had become human by ripping out her Grace which she describes as being like an energy that is intrinsic to angels. Sam manages to track down her Grace, which would turn her back into an angel and restore all her powers, but when the group goes to retrieve it, they find that it has already been taken. Anna receives an ultimatum from the angels, that she is to be given to them or else Dean will be sent back to Hell. The group seems to be at a loss for a plan. That night, Anna approaches Dean and tries to broach the subject of what happened in Hell. Although he can't talk about it, she offers him reassurance and kisses him, which culminates in them having sex in the Impala on her last night on Earth. Meanwhile, Ruby goes to Alastair with the proposition of her handing over Anna if he will let her and the Winchesters go. He instead captures and tortures her with her own knife for the others' location. At the same time, Dean is forced to give their location away to Uriel, who has invaded his dreams and is revealed to be the one who took Anna's Grace, under threat to Sam. The demons and angels arrive and battle each other. During the confusion, Anna retrieves her Grace from Uriel. In a flash of light, she becomes an angel again and she and Alastair vanish. Castiel and Uriel, too, leave, in pursuit of Anna. It is revealed that Ruby and Dean betraying the others was all part of Sam's plan to get the angels and demons to fight it out to give them the opportunity they needed. In the episode's ending, Dean confides in Sam that it was forty years in Hell instead of four months and that every day, Alastair tortured him and then offered him release from the torture if he tortured souls himself. After thirty years, Dean finally gave in, but is now haunted by his actions.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Since the previous episode, Sam and Dean have been hunting non-stop at Dean's insistence. This episode has them investigate a murderous young female spirit inside the walls of a suspected haunted house in Stratton, Nebraska. Complications ensue when a family of five moves in, and the "spirit" turns out to be two humans, a young pair of sibling feral children who are the product of incest and years of abuse and who are willing to kill to protect their home. The brothers fail to get the family to leave, but when the son is kidnapped through the walls, they look to Sam and Dean to rescue the boy. Dean manages to rescue the son, but is forced to shoot the feral brother dead in self-defense while the father of the family is forced to stab the girl to death to protect his wife and daughter. In the ending, Dean reflects on the children with pity, sympathizing with them on what they had become after a lifetime of abuse because of how he himself had tortured souls in Hell after being tortured to the breaking point. He believes that he is even worse than the feral children because they hadn't understood what they were doing and took no pleasure in it, whereas he had in Hell, having relished the opportunity to inflict pain on others after having endured so much himself.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean attend a magician's convention in Sioux City, Iowa where it seems that real magic is being performed. Their investigation leads them to Charlie (John Rubinstein), Jay (Barry Bostwick) and Vernon (Richard Libertini), three friends who were famous magicians in their day but have now been replaced by flashier, younger magicians. Jay's despair over this drives him to perform numerous tricks on-stage that should have killed him and yet come out unscathed, while magicians who had irritated the three older magicians die of mysterious wounds reflective of the trick at the same time. Sam and Dean suspect that Jay is a witch and go after him, but he is innocent. After Charlie is the next victim of his death tricks, Jay realizes that Vernon must be the one responsible and agrees to help Sam and Dean flush him out. However, Vernon is also innocent; the real witch is Charlie, who has faked his death and restored his youth. He had been protecting Jay because he regards Jay and Vernon as true friends, and offers to grant them both eternal youth and immortality as well. Jay refuses the offer and uses a trick to kill him for good in order to save Sam and Dean's lives. However, with Charlie dead and Vernon refusing to speak to him, he is left sad, bitter, and alone. Seeing this, Sam finally agrees to a proposition Ruby had made earlier in the episode to rejoin her in hunting Lilith and practicing his powers, despite that he has strong reservations against one of the unrevealed methods they are using because he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life hunting.</p></div></div>

While investigating the haunting, Dean and Sam relive their high school experiences through flashbacks, recalling how Sam (Colin Ford) was picked on by the school bully while Dean (Brock Kelly) was Mr. Popular. Initially, they believe it to be the ghost of a friend of Sam's who killed himself the year after they left, but when the ghost attacks Sam and calls him by name even after they burn the friend's bones, they realize it's someone else. They learn that the ghost haunts the bus and possesses people there and realize the bus driver is the father of the kid who bullied Sam, Dirk. Sam beat him in a fist-fight before they left the school and gave him the nickname "Dirk the Jerk." The brothers learn from Dirk's father that he died at age 18 before graduation and that he lived a hard life, losing his mother shortly before Sam met him and gaining a lot of anger as a result. He got picked on a lot and kids called him "Dirk the Jerk." After learning that Dirk was cremated and that he is tied to a lock of hair kept on the bus, Sam and Dean confront Dirk while he possesses two people and Dean burns his hair, destroying Dirk's spirit. In the end, Sam visits a teacher who gave him the advice to follow his own path in life, but is unable to respond when asked if he's happy.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean take on a case in Bedford, Iowa in which three men inexplicably beat their wives to death. The brothers realize that behind the murders is a siren, a creature that can take different forms and desperately needs love, compelling people to kill others or themselves as a show of devotion. The siren has been posing as different strippers at a strip-club to meet and seduce men. Dean suspects that the siren is a doctor who Sam took an attraction to and had sex with while Dean was at the strip-club and bonding with the FBI agent assigned to the case. However, the FBI agent reveals himself to be the siren; it had taken on the form of Dean's ideal little brother in order to get close to him and take Sam's place. The siren puts Sam and Dean both under its spell and then pits them against each other in a fight to the death for its love. The ensuing fight sees Dean poised to kill Sam with an axe before Bobby shows up and kills the siren with its own venom by dipping a bronze dagger in Dean's blood and flinging it into the fleeing siren's back. The siren's death breaks its hold over its victims. Although Bobby tells them that they hadn't been themselves under the siren's influence, bitterness and tension between the brothers remains, particularly about the cruel things they had said to one another Dean having said that Sam is no longer the person he knew and Sam having belittled Dean's trauma over Hell under the siren's spell.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean investigate the town of Greybull, Wyoming where people are miraculously surviving would-be fatal injuries and illnesses. They discover that Alastair (Christopher Heyerdahl) has kidnapped the town's reaper as part of a scheme to break one of the 66 seals by killing two reapers under the solstice moon, and they seek Pamela's help to stop him by using astral projection. She sends the brothers into the spiritual world, where the reaper Tessa (Lindsey McKeon) finds them and recognizes Dean, reawakening his memories of their encounter in the second season premiere "In My Time of Dying" with a kiss. She has come to take over reaping duties for the missing reaper, but gets spirited away by demons instead for them to use as the second reaper sacrifice. The brothers find the building where the demons are hiding, but are trapped by demons, who then go after Pamela and their inert bodies. Alastair succeeds in killing the local reaper, but Sam and Dean, having been taught how to use their spiritual abilities by the ghost of a young boy named Cole (Alexander Gould), manage to break the trap holding Tessa before Alastair can kill her. Tessa repays the favor by freeing the brothers and the three escape before Alastair and the other demons can stop them. Sam is pulled back into his body by Pamela, who has been mortally wounded by a demon. Believing that Pamela cannot see what he is doing, Sam uses his powers to exorcise the demon. However, it is too late to save Pamela, who begins to die due to Tessa beginning to reap the souls of Greybull. Alastair tracks Dean down alone and confronts him, but is captured by angels. Castiel explains to Dean that he had been the one who led them to this case because, although he and the other angels had known Alastair's plan, they hadn't been able to get to Alastair because the building the demons hid in was protected against them. Tessa then enlists Dean's help in convincing Cole to cross-over. After they succeed, she warns him to be wary of the angels and what they promise. At that moment, Pamela finishes in pulling Dean back into his body. The brothers are helpless to save or even reassure the dying Pamela, who spends her last words privately confiding in Sam that she knows what he did to the demon, that she knows what is inside him, and that, whatever he thinks of what he's doing, it is wrong. The episode ends with Dean asking what she said and Sam not answering.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In Cheyenne, Wyoming, someone has found a weapon that can kill angels and is responsible for several murders. Having captured Alastair, Castiel and Uriel demand that Dean use the torturing skills he learned in Hell to extract information from him so they can stop the murders. Dean refuses, but they transport him there and refuse to let him leave until he finally agrees to it. Anna comes to Castiel when he is alone and questions the morality of forcing Dean to torture Alastair, going so far as to question if God is even the one giving orders anymore, but Castiel rejects her and forces her to leave when she suggests that he work with her. Meanwhile, Sam calls upon Ruby to help him locate Dean because he doesn't believe that Dean can get the information. Sam then begins drinking Ruby's blood in order to regain his diminished power. Drinking her blood is how his powers have grown so much early in the season, and his decision to not drink it is why his powers had weakened. Alastair refuses to break despite the torture a vengeful Dean inflicts on him, but does taunt Dean by telling him that he, Dean, had broken the first seal when he began torturing people in Hell. An unseen force then frees Alastair, who tries to kill Dean and exorcise Castiel. Sam arrives and uses his increased power to torture and kill Alastair after the latter admits that no demon is behind the angel murders. Dean is subsequently taken to a hospital for the injuries he sustained from Alastair's attack. Castiel seeks Anna out and pleads for her to tell him what to do, but she tells him that he must learn to think for himself. Castiel soon realizes who is behind the murders and Alastair's escape: Uriel. Uriel had killed the angels who refused to join him in releasing Lucifer, and had freed Alastair to kill Dean and keep the blame on the demons. When Castiel refuses to join him, Uriel tries to kill him, but is killed by Anna instead, saving Castiel. Afterward, Castiel visits Dean in the hospital and confirms that Dean broke the first seal with his actions in Hell. Dean is left shattered by the revelation, telling Castiel to find someone else to save the world, because he can't.</p></div></div>

The next day, Sam dramatically quits his job while Dean, after being offered a promotion by his boss, reconsiders and decides to quit as well.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean are shocked to discover a book entitled Supernatural that accurately details their lives. They track down the author of the book, who turns out to be a prophet named Chuck Shurley (Rob Benedict). Once he realizes who they are, Chuck explains he has visions of the brothers that he then turns into cheesy novels. Chuck reveals that he had a vision of this encounter, and had also had a vision of Lilith coming for Sam. Lilith (Katherine Boecher) finds Sam alone, but neither have the power yet to harm each other. Having lost her desire to free Lucifer once she learned that she is destined to die right before the Apocalypse, Lilith suggests that Sam give her his and Dean's lives in exchange for her ceasing her attacks on the seals. When Sam tries to stab her with Ruby's knife instead, the two attempt to kill each other, only for Dean and Chuck to rush in on the confrontation. Earlier, Castiel had discreetly informed Dean that if Chuck were to be put in danger, the archangel protecting him would intervene to destroy the threat; taking heed of his advice, Dean brings Chuck to Lilith, with the resulting archangel appearance chasing the demon off and saving Sam. At the end of the episode, Chuck has a horrible vision of the future, but Zachariah prevents him from telling Sam and Dean about it. Hopeless, Chuck contemplates suicide, but Zachariah dismisses the idea by saying that he would only bring Chuck back to life, and tells Chuck to just keep writing.</p></div></div>

Dean and Sam suspect that Adam is a monster trying to lure them into a trap, but find out that John was indeed the boy's father. Unlike his half-brothers, Adam has had no experience with hunting or the supernatural until the recent disappearance of his mother. Sam tries to teach Adam to hunt so that he may defend himself in the future. Dean goes alone to find the thing that killed Adam's mother and is trying to kill Adam. Eventually, he gets trapped in a crypt with no way out, where he finds the real Adam's corpse; the Adam that is with Sam is the ghoul who killed and ate Adam to take on his form. The ghoul and his sister, in the form of Adam's mother, ambush Sam. They had wanted revenge on John for killing their parents years ago, but since they cannot kill him as he had already died in the second season, they decide to kill his remaining sons instead. Dean returns in time to kill the ghouls and save Sam from being eaten alive. Afterward, they give Adam a hunter's funeral to honor the half-brother they never knew.</p></div></div>

At the meeting spot, however, Sam and Dean find Castiel’s human vessel, Jimmy Novak, instead, who cannot recall what Castiel wanted to tell Dean. The characters speculate that Castiel has been attacked by other angels and dragged back to Heaven, where Anna fears that he will receive a terrible punishment for whatever he found out and wanted to tell Dean. Jimmy tries to return to his family and normal life, despite Dean and Sam's concerns about his and his family's safety. Their fears prove true when demons aim to capture Jimmy by possessing his wife and kidnapping his daughter. Sam, Dean, and Jimmy are captured trying to rescue them and Jimmy is shot. However, Castiel possesses Jimmy's daughter and he and Sam kill the demons. Sam, whose powers are failing from a lack of demon blood, drinks blood from a demon in front of a horrified Dean and Castiel, so that he can exorcise Jimmy's wife. Not wanting his daughter to have to suffer as Castiel's vessel, Jimmy has Castiel possess him once again, but Castiel refuses to tell Dean what he wanted to talk to him about, having learned his "lesson" that he serves Heaven and not humanity and certainly not Dean. Dean and Bobby then trick Sam and lock him in Bobby's panic room to detox from the demon blood which he is now addicted to.</p></div></div>

As Bobby sees more seals are being broken, he tells Dean they should let Sam out to help them fight the impending Apocalypse. Dean disagrees and goes to Castiel for help. Castiel tells Dean that he must swear to serve God in order to save Sam, and Dean does so. However, Castiel goes behind the hunters' backs to secretly free Sam from the panic room for an unknown purpose. When Anna confronts him on it, Castiel turns her over to other angels to be taken to Heaven for punishment, still without explaining his motives for releasing Sam. Sam tries to dodge Dean and Bobby, and feeds on Ruby, who says that she has been missing because she has been working to uncover more information on Lilith. She reveals that few seals remain to be broken, and that only Lilith can break the last seal. Dean finally finds the couple; he tries to kill Ruby, and, when Sam defends her, has a blowout confrontation with Sam about the dark choices Sam has been making, calling him a monster. The two brawl violently, ending with Sam leaving with Ruby after Dean tells him to never come back.</p></div></div>

Sam hesitates to kill the innocent person being possessed, but gives in after hearing a supernaturally-altered voicemail from Dean in which "Dean" threatens to kill Sam the next time he sees him. Meanwhile, Dean is transported to a room without any exits, where Zachariah explains to him that high-ranking angels such as himself are not trying to stop the final seal from being broken, in fact, they have secretly been manipulating events to start the Apocalypse, for they believe that it will cleanse the earth and bring Paradise. Dean's task is not stopping the Apocalypse from starting, but ending it once it has. Dean is furious at Castiel for deceiving him. Although Castiel refuses to help at first, he changes his mind and helps Dean escape, banishing Zachariah with a blood sigil. After getting Sam's location from Chuck, Castiel transports Dean there while he stays behind to confront Chuck's archangel. Dean arrives in time to see Sam confronting and overpowering Lilith, but Ruby keeps him from warning Sam that Lilith's death is in fact the final seal. Goaded by both Lilith and Ruby, Sam kills Lilith with his powers, unwittingly breaking the final seal. Ruby then reveals that she has been deceiving Sam all along to lead him to this moment, having worked for Lucifer the whole time. When Dean finally manages to break in, Sam distracts Ruby by grabbing and holding her in place so that Dean is able to kill her with her own knife. With the last seal broken, the brothers look on in terror as Lucifer begins to emerge from his opened cage.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>With the accidental freeing of the fallen angel Lucifer in the climax of the previous season finale by Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki), the Apocalypse has started. An unknown force whisks Sam and his brother Dean (Jensen Ackles) from the place that Lucifer has started his destructive rise, and transports them safely onto an airplane passing overhead. They seek information from the prophet Chuck Shurley (Rob Benedict), learning that their angelic ally Castiel (Misha Collins) has been killed for helping them, but he is unable to tell them much else because he is being watched by angels, who are working against the Winchesters to bring on the Apocalypse. Chuck later sends word through a fan of his work named Becky Rosen (Emily Perkins) that the angels have lost the sword of the archangel Michael—a weapon capable of defeating Lucifer—and gives them a cryptic clue as to its location. When Sam and Dean decode the clue, they are attacked by demons working for Lucifer, including their old enemy Meg Masters (Rachel Miner) and their now-possessed friend Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver). Bobby manages to overcome the demon long enough to stab himself with a demon-killing knife, severely wounding himself in the process. The Winchesters defeat the other demons, but Meg flees before they can kill her. The brothers take Bobby to the hospital, then set off to take Michael's sword before the demons do. They find the angel Zachariah (Kurt Fuller) at the place the sword is supposed to be, as Zachariah had purposefully planted the information that led them there in one of Chuck's prophetic visions. Zachariah explains that Dean is in fact Michael's "sword" as Michael's destined human host (called a "vessel"). However, Dean refuses to provide the permission required for Michael to possess him, even when Zachariah threatens to kill Sam and Bobby and tortures the brothers. Castiel soon appears and forces a frightened Zachariah to leave with the thinly-veiled suggestion that he has been miraculously revived (and Sam and Dean put on the plane) by God himself. He then hides Sam and Dean from angelic detection and disappears. Back at the hospital, Bobby is revealed to have been permanently paralyzed below the waist by spinal injuries from his having stabbed himself. Dean tries to bolster his friend's confidence by giving a stirring speech about beating both the angels and the demons, but admits to Sam in private that he believes that they are all doomed. He also admits that while he forgives Sam, he can't trust him anymore. Meanwhile, a man (Mark Pellegrino) whose family has been slaughtered by a killer begins having nightmares in which Lucifer appears to him in the form of his wife (Bellamy Young) and tries to convince him to let him take over his body so he can face God and seek justice. The man eventually agrees.</p></div></div>

Sam and Dean discover that Jesse was adopted; his biological mother reveals that she was impregnated by a demon, and that she gave Jesse up for adoption at birth. Castiel tells the Winchesters that Jesse is the Antichrist, a human/demon hybrid being imbued with essentially unlimited powers, and that they should kill it before Lucifer uses him. While Sam and Dean try to persuade Jesse to side with them, Jesse's biological mother, who has since been re-possessed by the demon father, attempts to persuade Jesse to side with her. After listening to the demon, Jesse renders her unable to speak in order to hear what Sam has to say. Sam tells Jesse that he has a choice and that it will haunt him forever if he makes the wrong one. Jesse then exorcises the demon from his mother and agrees to leave with the Winchesters. Pretending he wants to say goodbye to his adoptive parents, he goes upstairs and vanishes into thin air, protected by his powers, which make it impossible for the hunters to track him down.</p></div></div>

Dean still refuses to become a vessel, but before they leave, he frees Gabriel from his trap and accuses him of simply being too afraid to stand up against his own family.</p></div></div>

After an attempt to kill the hospital's chief of medicine, whom they suspect to be the monster, Sam is locked up and sedated with a heavy dose of tranquilizers. Despite his mind being paralyzed by the tricks the Wraith plays on it, Dean discovers that the wraith is the nurse who administered their tests in the beginning and kills it with a silver letter opener right before she is able to suck Sam's brain dry. The two then flee the mental institution and Sam admits that he has anger issues from everything that has happened.</p></div></div>

Thrilled with his new looks, Gary takes advantage of his new appearance by hitting on women and drinking alcohol. He meets up with Dean, who at first does not realize Sam is not the real Sam. The two start working on a case and kill a ghost together, although "Sam" seems to try to take a chance to kill Dean, unknowingly to Dean. Meanwhile, Sam is stuck in Gary's body and has to deal with his strict parents and high school. He finds out that Gary owns a book with satanic symbols all over it and sets off for his locker at high school. After he has retrieved the book, he is shot by Gary's friend Trevor with a tranquilizer gun. He and another friend of Gary's, Nora, take him to a basement and reveal that they have made a pact with a demon, who offered them everything they wanted in exchange for Sam and Dean. Trevor conjures the demon, who possesses Nora and kills Trevor, whose demands irritate the demon. As the demon tastes Trevor's innards it declares they "taste like moron". The demon (still in the form of Nora) goes after Gary and tries to persuade him to meet Lucifer and "answer one little question" with yes, which would let the Devil into his true vessel. Gary refuses and after Dean fails to kill the demon, he and Gary manage to exorcise it together. In the end, Gary reverses the spell and the boys take him home. Before leaving, Sam tells Gary that he should be glad to have a normal life and a family, but when he and Dean get into the car, he states that Gary's life "sucked ass", yet Dean counters by saying that perhaps they themselves just don't know the good things they're missing out on.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>The fallen angel Anna (Julie McNiven) has escaped from her prison in Heaven and is planning on killing Sam in order to prevent the Apocalypse. She calls Sam and Dean and asks them to meet her, but instead of the brothers encounter Castiel, who doesn't believe she has escaped but suspects there is something she is not telling them. Anna explains that she believes killing Sam will prevent the Apocalypse as without his true vessel, Lucifer won't be able to bring about the end of the world. However, Castiel refuses to let her near the Winchesters and she disappears. Later, Castiel meets up with the Winchesters and tells them that Anna has traveled back in time to 1978 to stop Mary and John Winchester from conceiving Sam. The three also travel to the past, which weakens Castiel considerably. When knocking at their parents' door, Mary recognizes Dean from his earlier visit and tells them to leave immediately, suspecting something bad is bound to happen. John, however, is thrilled to meet "relatives" from Mary's side of the family and invites them in. Anna poses as John's employer and calls him at home, telling him to come to the garage he works at. After arriving there, he is attacked by Anna. The brothers and Mary come to rescue him, and Sam is able to drive Anna out of the building by using a magical sigil. They flee to a shelter, where Dean has a talk with Mary, in which he reveals that he and Sam are her sons and that she has to leave John in order to prevent her sons from being born. However, she reveals that she is already pregnant. Suddenly, Anna and an earlier Uriel rush into the house, attacking the Winchesters which allows Anna to kill Sam. Just as Anna is about to kill Mary, the Archangel Michael, having possessed John's body, enters the room and burns Anna to death. He reveals that Cain and Abel are the brothers' ancestors and that their destiny as Michael and Lucifer's true vessels has been set since those ancient times. While he loves Lucifer, having practically raised him like Dean did Sam, he feels he has to kill his brother as he is a "good son" and that there is no such thing as free will, that everything is predestined. He then revives Sam, erases Mary and John's memory, and sends the brothers back to their time. Despite Michael's words, Dean is still determined to win their way.</p></div></div>

They call Castiel, who suspects a rogue Cupid to be responsible for the deaths. Castiel summons the Cupid and asks him about the strange incidents, but the angel of love says he is only acting on higher orders, but that killings are not his work. After examining another victim's body, Sam follows a suspicious man and confronts him. Sam fights him and grazes him with Ruby's knife, which reveals that he is a demon. The demon flees and leaves his briefcase behind, and Sam finds his addiction to demon blood return. Soon, people start dying from binge eating or alcohol poisoning, and Castiel develops a weird craving for red meat, which leads them to believe that one of the Four Horsemen, Famine, who causes people to give in to their desires, is behind the deaths. They open the briefcase, which contains a human soul of a person. Castiel states that Famine harvests the souls of the people he killed and consumes them. Later, Dean and Castiel set out to face Famine and cut off the finger on which he wears the ring containing his power. They lock up Sam in order to prevent him from giving into his cravings and follow the demons who harvested a soul for Famine to devour. Meanwhile, demons enter the room where Sam is chained up. Sam breaks free, attacks the demons and satisfies his thirst. When Dean and Castiel arrive at the diner in which they suspect Famine to dwell, Castiel enters the building in order to attack Famine, but is held up by his desire for red meat. Dean walks in and is assaulted by the demons guarding Famine. Famine then states that Dean is not responding to his curse because he is empty inside and there is nothing that can satisfy his hunger. When Sam suddenly appears, Famine offers him the demons guarding himself, but Sam refuses. He exorcises them, and Famine devours their essences. Sam tries to use his powers on the Horseman, but Famine states that Sam's abilities will not work on him. Instead of killing the Horseman himself, Sam uses his powers to destroy the demons Famine had just swallowed, effectively killing Famine. In the end, Dean and Castiel lock Sam in Bobby's panic room in order to detox the demon blood out of his system. When Dean cannot bear to listen to Sam's screams anymore, he walks outside and calls to God for help. The name refers to the film of the same name that actor Jensen Ackles was in, as well as referencing to Devour, another film he was also in.</p></div></div>

Suspicious, Dean investigates further and comes face to face with Bobby's dead wife, who seems to have no memory of what has happened to her. Soon the zombies start to become evil one by one, killing and eating their loved ones. The brothers urge Bobby to kill his "wife" before she does the same. Bobby refuses because he wants to spend a few happy hours with his resurrected wife and says that as soon as she turns evil he will take care of it. Shortly after, his wife shows signs of becoming a flesh-eating zombie. Weakened by the disease, she lies down to rest and tells Bobby that she actually remembers her demonic possession and death. She also delivers a message from Death. As Dean and Bobby prepare to head out to fight the zombies, Bobby's salvage yard is swarmed with them and Dean and Bobby end up trapped. They are rescued by Sam and local sheriff Jody Mills (guest star Kim Rhodes) who found out the horrifying truth after her son killed her husband. In the end, Bobby reveals that the rise of the dead took place in his hometown because Death wanted to break his spirit since he stands in the way of Lucifer's plans by helping the Winchesters.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Ambushed by angry hunters, Sam and Dean are killed and sent to Heaven. Castiel, talking through radios and a TV, explains to the brothers that Zachariah is searching for them. The Winchesters' task is to find the angel Joshua, who is rumored to be able to talk to God, in the Garden at the end of the Road, or Axis Mundi, through heaven. Trying to escape from Zachariah's persecution, Sam and Dean re-live the happiest moments of their lives. On their way they meet Ash, living in an illusional Roadhouse. He says that the people sent to Heaven are rewarded for their good deeds with a replica of their happiest memory. They also encounter Pamela, who states that being dead and in Heaven is not so bad, after all. Eventually, Zachariah finds the brothers and begins to torture Dean, saying that he is sick of being condemned by his fellow angels because he cannot handle "one little human." However, he is stopped by Joshua, who claims to be acting on orders from God. Taking the Winchesters to the Garden, Joshua tells Dean that God will not help them. It is revealed that He is the one who put them on that airplane in "Sympathy for the Devil", brought back Castiel and now granted them salvation in Heaven. However, He does not feel the Apocalypse is his problem and will do no more to help. Joshua then returns them to Earth with their memories, where the brothers meet Castiel and tell him everything. Castiel curses God and gives Dean his amulet back, stating that it is useless now. As the brothers leave the motel, Sam tries to convince Dean that they can still stop the Apocalypse. Before walking out the door, Dean throws his amulet into the trash can, leaving faith at the door.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean are cornered by demons, but saved at the last minute by Rob and his townspeople, who are aware of the Apocalypse and have been training to fight and kill demons. The small town has become very religious, and the brothers meet Pastor Gideon, who introduces them to his daughter Leah. She has been receiving visions from angels and guiding the townspeople to demons, whom the townspeople always seem to defeat and exorcise. Eventually Leah begins telling the locals that they are "Chosen" to win the Apocalypse and see their dead loved ones again in a Paradise on Earth, but to do so must get rid of "sinners" among them whose names the angels are giving to her. The brothers learn that Leah has been replaced by the Whore of Babylon, a creature from Hell that emerges during the Apocalypse and tries to condemn as many people as possible to eternal punishment in Hell by tricking them into committing Deadly Sins. The Whore had only been sending locals on demon hunting trips to earn their trust, and the exorcisms are fake. Her true agenda is to cause the townspeople to kill as many of each other as she can, and damn their souls to Hell. She can only be killed with a cypress wooden stake from a tree in Babylon and by the hand of a true servant of Heaven. The Pastor has become concerned by Leah's increasingly ruthless behavior, and while walking outside is confronted by Castiel who informs him of the truth. Reuniting with Sam and Dean, the Pastor is informed that Leah is not his real daughter but the creature that killed her. The demonic creature has to be killed and they point out that the Pastor is a true servant of Heaven. They halt the Whore just before she and her "Chosen" can burn the "sinner" townspeople to death. The Pastor is knocked out and the Whore begins battling Dean, but he manages to stake her, proving to a surprised Sam that he is a true servant of Heaven. Sam asks him if he is going to do something stupid like saying "yes" to the angel Michael. In the end, Dean leaves Sam to drive and see Lisa and tells her that, in the next few days, she's going to see "trippy" things on TV, but she need not worry because he is going to make arrangements to protect her and her son, Ben. He also confesses that when he dreams of having a happy family it is with her and Ben. Lisa is terrified and asks Dean to stay, have a beer and talk for a while, but Dean declines and leaves.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Before Dean can go to say yes to Michael, Sam and Castiel capture him and lock him in Bobby's panic room. At the same time, the angels decide they don't need him anymore. Instead, Zachariah uses Dean and Sam's half-brother, Adam, to serve as Michael's vessel as he is related to the Winchesters by blood. Castiel rescues Adam as he revives and brings him to see his brothers and Bobby. But Adam has no problem being Michael's vessel as the angels promised to reunite him with his deceased mother and Sam tries to talk him out of it. Since Dean still has the intention to accept the archangel, Castiel and Sam lock him in a cell but Dean tricks Castiel into releasing him and escapes. Adam is convinced by Zachariah to act his part and he leaves voluntarily. Dean is chased down by Castiel and enraged at his betrayal and willingness to give in so easily, the angel drags Dean into an alleyway before subjecting him to a brutal beating that leaves Dean with several injuries. When Dean tells him to do it, Castiel knocks him unconscious and takes him back to Bobby's house. Upon going with Zachariah, Adam discovers that the angels have fooled him into tricking Dean to become Michael's vessel. Sam trusts Dean not to give himself up to the angels and releases him to help rescue Adam. Castiel goes inside the warehouse and confronts a group of angels, using a sigil on his body to banish himself and the angels away while Dean and Sam enter. They attempt to take Adam with them but are confronted by Zachariah. The angel tortures both Sam and Adam to force Dean to say yes. Dean relents and tells Zachariah to summon Michael. However, Dean reveals he's made a few conditions in order to have Michael possess him, with the first being Zachariah will be killed by Michael. Zachariah doubts Michael will hurt him, even for Dean's yes, but Dean kills Zachariah himself instead with an angel sword through the head. As Michael descends, the three brothers flee but Adam is trapped inside. Dean is unable to go back in to save Adam due to the searing heat and light, and when he enters the room moments later, the room holding Adam has disappeared. Later, Dean apologizes to Sam for his decision and tells his brother they will take the fight to them, whether they be angels or Lucifer having regained his faith due to Sam's unshakable faith in him.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean end up in a seemingly one-star motel at the side of the road in Muncie, Indiana, but it turns out to be a four-star hotel with staff who are a little too friendly for the brothers' liking. They soon discover strange things happen at the hotel and guests are disappearing one at a time. They are soon trapped by the staff, who turn out to be a group of pagan gods, including Kali, Ganesh, Mercury, Zao Shen, Baron Samedi, Odin, and Baldur, and who want to use them as bargaining chips to stop the Apocalypse. Dean and Sam are soon joined by Gabriel under his Loki persona, who is willing to help them out. While he distracts Kali, Dean and Sam try to free the other trapped guests, however Kali is on to Gabriel and steals his sword and kills him. The brothers make a deal: release the guests and they will help the gods kill Lucifer. The gods reluctantly agree and Dean leads the hostages outside and stumbles upon a very much alive Gabriel, who explains the sword was a fake. He tells Dean he can't kill Lucifer because he's his brother, and Dean goes back inside the hotel. Lucifer is summoned by Mercury. He arrives and kills Mercury, and all of the other gods save for Kali. Gabriel shows up to help the brothers and sends them away. As he faces Lucifer for the first time in centuries, Gabriel tells him he's not loyal to him or Michael, but to humans, because despite their flaws, they're always willing to try harder and forgive. As Gabriel makes his move, Lucifer is onto him and kills him. Outside, Dean and Sam watch a movie Gabriel gave to them, in which the archangel explains to them that they can't kill Lucifer, but they can trap him back in Hell. All they need are the four rings that belong to the Horsemen to do this. As Dean and Sam set out to find them, Pestilence is revealed to be on Earth spreading disease.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Dean and Sam encounter Crowley while on the trail of Pestilence. Both brothers are angry at Crowley for giving them the Colt which did not work on Lucifer which he claims not to have known. Crowley mentions that he's being hunted down by his fellow demons and tells the brothers that he knows where the last two rings can be found. He directs them to Brady, the demon Handler for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. However, Crowley will only show the way if Sam does not go with them. Later, Sam and Bobby have an argument over Sam intending to trick Lucifer back into Hell by letting Lucifer possess him. Dean meets Brady, the demon-possessed CEO of a pharmaceutical company, who is under Pestilence's orders. Dean tries to trick Brady with a proposition but the demon does not buy it, intending to just kill Dean. However, Crowley gets the drop on Brady and knocks him unconscious. Dean is warned by Crowley that Sam and Brady have a history; Brady is in fact Sam's classmate from college. The Handler possessed Brady since sophomore year, and deliberately introduced Jessica to Sam to put Azazel's plans into motion. Sam is furious and wants to kill Brady but Dean stops him. While Crowley is away, Sam traps Dean in the bathroom as he plans to kill Brady. Brady goads Sam into killing him by revealing he killed Jessica, not Azazel, but Sam manages to calm himself and leave. Crowley returns after killing a nest of demons and making it look as though Brady joined his side. However, Crowley is tracked down by a hellhound. Crowley escapes, leaving Dean, Sam and Brady in the hideout. While Dean attempts to fight off the hellhound, Crowley returns with his own hound against the other hound. After the four of them escape, Brady gives up the location for Pestilence. Dean then allows Sam to finish Brady off. Later, Crowley appears to Bobby and tells him he will reveal Death's location in exchange for his soul.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Dean and Sam finally hear from Castiel again, but he cannot go to them because his "batteries" are drained and he has no more power; he's now practically human. Dean and Sam go after Pestilence, and nearly die from a hailstorm of diseases. Castiel shows up (he took a bus) and cuts off the Horseman's finger, using the last of his angelic strength to resist Pestilence's plagues. He takes the ring, but not before Pestilence tells them that "it's too late". Upon rejoining with Bobby, the brothers learn how Bobby "pawned" his soul to Crowley in exchange for the location of the fourth, final, and most powerful of the Four Horsemen, Death. Crowley explains that Bobby's soul is his insurance, and that he won't give it back until everything has cooled down. It turns out the deal includes a bonus; Bobby can walk again. The group splits up; Sam, along with Castiel and Bobby, head out in order to find and contain the Croatoan virus (disguised and being distributed as a swine flu vaccine). On the way, Castiel hears about Sam's plan concerning Lucifer and surprisingly encourages him. However, he warns Sam that Michael has already found a human vessel: Adam. The battle between Michael and Lucifer will commence if Sam isn't able to resist possession. At the shipping warehouse, the three are able to contain the virus and shoot those who have been infected by it. Meanwhile, Dean goes with Crowley to find Death and get the last ring. They locate Death in Chicago, which according to Bobby is about to be wiped out by the storm of the millennium. As the rain starts, Death and Dean meet in a pizza parlor, littered with the bodies of customers and staff. Death explains that he is tied to Lucifer through a spell. This is the only reason he didn't try to find Dean, but has instead had to wait for him. He offers to give him his ring, but there is one condition; agree to Sam saying yes to Lucifer so they can lure him into the trap. He'll also spare Chicago. ("I like the pizza," Death says.) Dean agrees, receiving the ring and instructions on how to use all four of them to trap Lucifer. Upon returning, he tells Bobby he lied to Death's face, but Bobby says that Death is Death, and asks Dean if he's more afraid to lose, or to lose his brother.</p></div></div>

Chuck reveals their time spent in the Impala and how they made it their home throughout the years before and after they began hunting. Dean finally agrees to allow Sam to say yes to Lucifer while Sam requests he not try to bring him back and to have a normal life with Lisa and Ben when he's gone. Remembering a comment made by Lucifer in the future, Dean realizes that the fallen angel is in Detroit. Sam and Dean confront Lucifer, who knows of their plan to use the Horsemen's rings to trap him back in his cage. Despite this, Sam offers himself as a vessel, hoping that he can overcome Lucifer's control and throw himself into the prison. Lucifer is too strong, and Sam disappears in his body. As Lucifer tries to make Sam happy by killing the demons sent by Azazel to manipulate him during his childhood, Dean learns from Chuck the time and location of the final battle between Michael and Lucifer. The following day at the battleground—Stull Cemetery in Stull, KS (just outside Lawrence, Kansas) — Lucifer tries to talk Michael out of fighting, but he refuses. However, Castiel interrupts the fight by banishing Michael with holy fire. An angry Lucifer kills Castiel, and then snaps Bobby's neck when he shoots him. He then starts brutally beating Dean, but stops when he notices an old army man of Sam's inside the Impala revealed earlier during Chuck's narration. Sam remembers his life growing up with Dean, and manages to take control of his body. He uses the rings to reopen the door to the cage, and prepares to jump inside. Michael returns and tries to stop him, but he too is pulled into the pit while grappling with Sam. Castiel, resurrected again by God as a more powerful angel, heals Dean and brings Bobby back to life. He returns to Heaven, hoping to bring order now that Michael is gone. As Dean attempts to move on, he seems to turn his back on hunting and returns to Lisa. Chuck smiles after finishing his narration of the story, and vanishes into thin air. Later that night, a streetlight flickers out and Sam is revealed outside Lisa's home, looking in the window at the "family" eating dinner together...</p></div></div>

Dean leaves Lisa and Ben with Bobby so he and Sam can kill the Djinn tormenting the people close to Dean. Unbeknownst to Sam and Dean, Samuel captures one of the Djinn during the fight.

The brothers take the baby (revealed to be a shape-shifter) to Samuel, who decides to raise it as a hunter, which infuriates Dean. However, before they can decide the baby's future, a shape-shifter breaks in and kidnaps the baby. The shape-shifter was apparently the father of all shape-shifters (the alpha), and was much stronger than the others. Samuel secretly talks to someone on the phone promising he'll capture the alpha. After losing the baby, Dean returns to Lisa, and tells her that he is not sure whether he should stay to protect her and Ben, or go to make sure nothing happens to them. Lisa tells Dean to leave, but just come back home whenever he can.</p></div></div>

The three find that the officers were involved in the shooting of a young man, whose brother has the staff, which he got from an angel in exchange for his soul. Castiel deduces that the angel responsible, Balthazar (Sebastian Roché), has split the staff into pieces to be able to buy more souls. When Castiel confronts Balthazar in his residence, Balthazar explains he deserted Heaven and thanks Castiel for creating the current situation. Raphael arrives and Balthazar leaves Castiel to deal with the mess. Before Castiel is killed by Raphael, Balthazar returns and uses what appears to be a white crystal to disintegrate Raphael's host into salt (apparently used on Lot's wife when she looked back at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah). Dean uses holy fire to trap Balthazar and force him to return Aaron's soul. Castiel releases Balthazar for repaying his rescue and both angels depart with no explanation to the brothers. Later, Dean questions Sam on his recent actions and thinks something's different with him.</p></div></div>

Throughout the weekend, Bobby provides support for the Winchester brothers and the rest of the hunters, helps fellow hunter Rufus bury a Japanese okami demon (later having to kill it again himself) and contends with an FBI agent trying to find Rufus. Dean tells Bobby about Sam's changes and his problems, but Bobby is distracted by other calls. When Dean scolds Bobby for being selfish and cold for not listening, Bobby snaps and reprimands both brothers, reminding them he also has his own problems and he can't always be there for them. Bobby learns from the Crossroads demon that Crowley's real name is Fergus Macleod and he is now the King of Hell. He then calls up Crowley's long deceased son Gavin for information and summons Crowley to threaten him to return his soul. Crowley refuses until Gavin himself tells his father that he told Bobby everything he could know about him. Crowley is shaken but remains unmoved until Dean and Sam call to reveal that they are at his grave in Scotland, ready to burn his bones. Crowley reluctantly returns Bobby's soul and destroys the contract, and goes to Scotland to pick up his remains. Later, Bobby thanks the brothers for helping him with this, and once again returns to his usual work.</p></div></div>

While there, the brothers get separated and Dean gets confronted by a vampire named Boris who turns him while Sam seemingly just watches and lets it happen. Afterwards, believing Samuel is going to kill him when he arrives, Dean visits Lisa and Ben to say goodbye but nearly drains Lisa and shoves Ben. When Samuel arrives, he reveals to Dean that as he hasn't drank human blood, there is a cure, but he cannot drink and he must get the blood of Boris for it to work. Dean uses his new senses to track the nest down while a suspicious Samuel confronts Sam as he knows about the cure and Samuel suspects Sam let Dean get turned to get someone on the inside though Sam denies it. At the nest, Boris reveals he wants Dean to be a "recruiter" and that the vampires are building an army under the orders of their "father", the Alpha Vampire. As Boris figures Dean out, the Alpha Vampire sends a telepathic message to all vampires, including Dean, ordering them to continue recruiting. Waking up, Dean is confronted by the entire nest and kills them all single-handedly. Boris confronts him, telling Dean that he has stopped nothing, but Dean kills him anyway. Sam and Samuel track Dean down and cure him, but while reverting to human, he sees that Sam seemingly left him to be turned and becomes suspicious of his brother.</p></div></div>

As Sam appears to have told the truth, they continue their hunt and discover it is the goddess of truth, Veritas who is invoking the spell. But things don't go as planned as brothers are taken captive by Veritas and she is shocked to see that Sam is unaffected by her spell and he has been lying to Dean all along. As Veritas prepares to eat them, the brothers break free and kill her before Dean confronts Sam. Sam finally admits he has been lying and that he allowed Dean to get turned, telling him he knew about the cure. Sam explains that he doesn't know why, but he just doesn't care about anything anymore. Enraged, Dean beats Sam unconscious.</p></div></div>

He then sends the brothers to investigate a murder that appears to be a werewolf attack in Buffalo, New York. The two brothers arrive at a scene of another murder and learn that the second victim was murdered in the same way as the first. After some research, Sam discovers Cal Garrigan is the common denominator between the killings. They interview Cal and meet his girlfriend Mandy, Mandy's son Aiden and their dog Lucky. The brothers spy on Cal overnight, but see nothing; after they leave, Cal is killed by Lucky. Sam sees the dog Lucky transform into a man and follows him out of the house. There is a chase and Lucky is hit by a van. It turns out the killers are not werewolves but skin-walkers. Sam and Dean trap Lucky at an animal hospital and convince him that it would be better to give up his pack than to risk the family he loves. Lucky tells the two that the skin-walkers plan to infiltrate families as pet dogs and upon given a signal, turn the families into skin-walkers. Dean decides to eliminate the leader of the pack and there is a shootout. All the skin-walker pack except Lucky are killed, but he escapes, wounded. Lucky then goes back to Mandy to thank her for her kindness, but she tells him to leave and never come back. Afterwards, Sam, who Dean has been insisting is no longer the same without his soul, finally admits Dean is right and that he doesn't care about Dean or anything and asks Dean's help to get his soul back.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>The Winchester brothers investigate a series of disappearances in the town of Elwood, Indiana resembling alien abductions. They question the first victim's father, Brennan, a watchmaker who is adamant that his son will never return. Dean is apparently abducted; Sam goes to a UFO gathering to learn more about the abductions. Dean is sent back hours later and is annoyed to find Sam spending the night with a groupie from the gathering instead of searching for him. Continuing their research, Dean begins seeing a strange man only he can see and encounters a Tinkerbell-like fairy radiating an energy sphere. Dean tries to convince Sam of the bizarre events but Sam remains skeptical. Dean checks out Brennan's shop, only to find elves working inside. Sam asks Brennan for the truth and is told that he summoned a leprechaun two months ago. The leprechaun makes him a deal to have his elves build watches and save his shop and reputation, but will take his first-born in exchange. Dean is followed by the strange man and ambushes him, only to mistakenly attack another man and is arrested for assault. Sam and Brennan attempt to undo the spell but Brennan is killed by the leprechaun, who turns out to be a UFO enthusiast (Robert Picardo) seen throughout the episode. He used the faked UFO sightings as cover up for the leprechauns' activities. The leprechaun senses the lack of a soul in Sam and makes an offer to get it back for him, but Sam declines and attacks him. Finally, Sam empties a rock salt shotgun shell onto the floor which forces the leprechaun to count each grain, and reads the spell to send all of them back to where they came from. Later, Dean asks Sam why he did not take the leprechaun's deal, and Sam replies that deals are never a good thing.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean are ambushed by Meg the demon and some of her followers loyal to Lucifer, who are running from Crowley. Sam proposes a bargain: Meg will get to kill Crowley, if she can help them eventually recover Sam's soul. Meg agrees, and Sam decides to seek insurance in case of treachery. They try to get assistance from Samuel, who refuses - Crowley has promised to resurrect Sam and Dean's mother. Later, Samuel appears to have a change of heart, and tells the brothers and Castiel about a hidden monster prison Crowley is running, torturing creatures for information on Purgatory. During their preparation to attack the compound, Castiel voices his concern that since Sam's soul was locked with the very angry Michael and Lucifer, the ravages upon Sam's soul would either kill him or render him insane or broken. While attempting to infiltrate the compound, Meg's demons are killed by a hellhound, and Meg fights the creatures to buy the others time. Samuel has betrayed the brothers, forcing Castiel out of the building with a sigil spell and trapping Sam and Dean with Crowley's help. Sam escapes his guards, rescues Dean by killing the pair of ghouls, then Dean kills the demon controlling Christian, who found Meg and was torturing her for information. Together, the group tricks Crowley into stepping into a devil's trap, where Crowley states that getting the soul would be impossible, even for him. Crowley frees himself from the trap when Meg attacks him. Castiel reappears with Crowley's remains in tow, and once again Crowley professes that he cannot get Sam's soul back. Castiel immediately sets the bones ablaze, killing Crowley. Meg quickly vanishes, and Castiel leaves to fight a losing war against Raphael. Sam walks away from Dean stating that he doesn't want his soul back, as he is better off without it.</p></div></div>

Dean tells Bobby and Sam of the plan, which Sam strongly disagrees with, but Dean goes ahead anyway. Dean is accompanied by Tessa to reap various people. Eventually, however, Dean has to reap a 12-year-old girl with a heart condition, which he refuses, and the girl begins to make a miraculous recovery. However, due to the change in the 'natural order', others die instead. Failing in the deal, Dean reaps the girl, admitting that though the natural order sucks, it must be adhered to. While Dean is acting as Death, Sam summons the angel Balthazar to learn how to prevent his soul from returning to his body. Balthazar admits that there is a spell, but it requires the "blood of the father" - patricide. Since Sam's father had passed on years ago, a surrogate - Bobby - would be necessary. Sam then attempts to chase down Bobby, who catches on to Sam's attempt to kill him and tries to stop him. Eventually, Sam gains the upper hand, and prepares to kill Bobby, only to be stopped and knocked out by Dean. Unsure of what to do about Sam, Dean is surprised by Death, who has come to reclaim his ring. Dean realizes that Death's game was rigged, and Death brushes off the accusation, revealing that he will still retrieve Sam's soul as Dean has learned a lesson about the natural order of things. Death also hints to Dean that there is some important realization about human souls that he must discover. Death then appears to Sam, soul in tow, and instructs Sam not to scratch at the wall he built around the Hell memories. Death then pushes the soul into a screaming and pained Sam.</p></div></div>

Dean and Sam investigate some disappearances of girls who are virgins in Portland, Oregon only to find that dragons are behind the kidnappings. Bobby sends Dean to Dr. Visyak, a professor in medieval mythology who has had experience in fighting dragons. She tells Dean that in order to kill the dragons, he needs a blade that has been forged in dragon's blood. However, they can use a powerful dragon-killing sword, one of which she has in her basement. Meanwhile Sam is researching where the dragon's hideout is and finds out they are staying in the underground sewers. Sam then begs for Castiel to be in his presence at which point Castiel shows up and tells Sam everything that has happened while he was soulless. Sam and Dean then go into the sewers and find virgin girls locked in a cage. As Sam and Dean are attempting to unlock the cage, they are interrupted by two dragons (in human form) and have a fight. They manage to kill one of the dragons while the other one escapes. They end up back at Bobby's and Sam apologizes to Dean for everything he has done, saying that Castiel told him everything. Bobby has learned the dragons are trying to open Purgatory to let something "big" walk the planet named the "Mother of All" and that they are reading an "instruction manual" on how to open it. Meanwhile the dragons still have one of the virgins; they work an incantation and shove her into a fiery pit. The virgin then flies out of the pit possessed by the "Mother of All".</p></div></div>

Upon arriving in the town, they discover that Samuel and Sam had been there before, working on a hunt where men had gone missing. However, as time progresses in the town, Sam's memories of his prior visit begin to surface, such as beating a suspicious police officer and having sex with various witnesses (who were now the victims). Sam is even arrested by the officer who he had beaten, and then confronted with the local sheriff's wife, Brenna Dobbs. Sam professes that he has no recollection of what happened, and Brenna frees him from jail. As the investigation continues, Sam realizes that he and Samuel had originally hunted an Arachne in the town, and Sam used Sheriff Dobbs as bait to lure in the creature. Upon finding Dobbs and the other abducted men, Sam successfully killed the Arachne and proceeded to kill the abducted men, as he believed that the men were poisoned and beyond help. It is later shown that the Arachne had not captured the men to feed, but to propagate the species, turning Dobbs and the other victims from a year ago into Arachnes as well, all of whom survived. Dobbs reveals himself by baiting Sam and Dean, and trapping them in webbing. While explaining what happened to him, and that the women he kidnapped have all been turned into Arachnes and scattered everywhere, Dean uses a shard of glass to cut the webbing and attack Dobbs. Brenna frees Sam, who decapitates Dobbs. Sam then tries to apologize to Brenna, but she does not wait to hear him. The episode ends with Sam, having "scratched the wall" as Dean had feared, being gripped in a flashback of his time in Hell and unable to respond to Dean.</p></div></div>

Another murder takes place in another town, and they suspect a ghost controlled a mannequin to kill them. While investigating, Dean receives a call from Ben telling him Lisa is acting strange and he goes to see what is going on. Sam then discovers that both victims used to work together in a factory, and the janitor resigned after the strange death of a female worker called Rose. After a talk with her sister, Isabelle, Sam saves another guy that worked in the factory from getting killed and explained to him that he and a group of guys accidentally killed her because of a cruel joke they played on her. Sam then leaves and burns the body, thinking the case is solved, although the worker he just saved is killed that same night. After talking to Lisa, Dean realizes that Lisa has been trying to forget him but he keeps appearing in her life and that she still has feelings for him. Dean then talks to Ben who clearly wants Dean back in their lives. Sam then returns to Isabelle, looking for anything she could still be attached to and discovers Rose gave her a kidney when they were younger so if they cut the kidney out Isabelle would die. Dean comes back to see Isabelle, but Rose possesses the Impala and tries to kill Dean, who manages to escape, resulting in the Impala crashing and both sisters finally dying. After that, the brothers have a talk about how they got an innocent girl killed to save those guys and if they are actually doing the right thing.</p></div></div>

Sam and Dean attempt to return to their reality, but are hampered by their actors' lives and by the crew of their TV show. One of Raphael's assassins arrives to kill them and slaughters most of the TV crew, but the brothers best him because he has lost all his powers in this reality. Sam and Dean are then pulled back into their own universe by Raphael (Lanette Ware). Balthazar and Castiel appear and reveal that the key was a ruse to divert Raphael's attentions from the real transaction: Castiel now owns the weapons of Heaven that Balthazar stole. Raphael flees the area when Castiel threatens him. The brothers are frustrated with Castiel's using them as a decoy, but Castiel is evasive in explaining himself and only says that he will tell them more later.</p></div></div>

They determine there are no spirits or monsters involved, and remain at a loss. Inexplicably, Ellen (Samantha Ferris) and Jo Harvelle are both very much alive; in fact, Ellen is Bobby's wife. She traces the family trees of the victims, discovering their ancestors all immigrated to the United States in 1912 on the Titanic, a ship none of them have ever heard of that narrowly missed an iceberg on its maiden voyage. It is ultimately revealed that Castiel had given Balthazar the order to go back in time and save the Titanic from ever having sunk, creating a chain reaction in which more souls are produced to fuel Castiel's side's power in the Heaven civil war. One of the side-effects of the chain reaction is that Ellen and Jo never died. It transpires that Atropos of the three sisters of Fate is responsible for the freak accidents, as she is trying to kill all the descendants of the Titanic survivors who now exist but shouldn't. To protect Sam and Dean from the wrath of Atropos—who is already angry at the Winchesters for making her irrelevant—and her sisters—who would kill the brothers in revenge if Castiel were to kill Atropos—Castiel is forced to undo the timeline and make everything as it was before the episode, including the Titanic having sunk and the Harvelles being dead.</p></div></div>

In 1861, the brothers witness the hanging of Elias Finch, who informs the judge, the sheriff, and the deputy that they are all going to burn. Sam and Dean learn that Colt is building some railroads 20 miles away from the town. Finch reappears to burn the judge and sheriff to death, and Dean is proclaimed as the new town sheriff.

Back in 1861, Dean uses the deputy as bait for Finch, who can't go through the iron bars protecting him. Finch kills him with a gun instead, and starts to chase Dean. Sam has Colt's gun, on loan, and gives it to Dean, who kills Finch with it. Cas brings them back to the present before they are able to collect the ashes.

In the diner, where everyone else is a hybrid, Eve tells Sam and Dean that Crowley is still alive and is after the power of the souls, not the purgatory and is also torturing her children. She takes the form of Mary to show them what is mother's love. Her plan is to ruin Crowley's plans by sending souls to Purgatory instead of Hell (only monsters go to Purgatory). Dean refuses to deal, and Eve tries to turn him, but he drank whiskey mixed with phoenix ashes earlier, which poisons her. Castiel kills the hybrids and spirits the men away. Sam, Dean and Bobby argue because they are suspicious of Castiel, thinking he let Crowley live. Crowley meets with Cas at the diner, saying he is tired of cleaning up his messes.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>The majority of the episode is from Castiel's perspective. He is no longer sure that stopping the Apocalypse was the right choice. He also reveals that he was the one that pulled Sam from Hell, but didn't have the power to pull him out all the way, though he was unaware of it at the time. Dean lies to Castiel to cover up that they are interrogating a demon to find Crowley. Castiel goes to meet with Crowley who is doing experiments with Eve's corpse. Crowley thinks the Winchesters are distracting Castiel, and tells him to kill them, but Castiel refuses, warning Crowley not to touch the brothers. Cas observes Sam, Dean and Bobby while invisible, then saves them from demons, but a slip lets them know their suspicions are correct. Continuing his monologue, Cas reveals he started the civil war in Heaven, using 50,000 souls from Hell, because Raphael wanted to raise Michael and Lucifer and resume the Apocalypse. The brothers summon Castiel and trap him in a circle of holy fire. Dean asks if Castiel is working with Crowley, and from Castiel's inability to look him in the eyes, Dean knows the answer. Crowley then appears to release Castiel, repeating that the Winchesters are holding him back. Back at Bobby's, Castiel appears to Dean, telling him to understand that he is doing this for him. Dean asks him to trust him and stop what he is doing, because he's like a brother to him, but Castiel says he won't. Dean then says he will do anything to stop him. Castiel asks God for a sign to see if what he is doing is right or wrong, and says that if God doesn't answer him, he will do whatever it takes. There is no sign.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Crowley has Lisa and Ben kidnapped as a warning to Dean not to meddle in his plans. The brothers summon Balthazar for help but to no avail. Their investigation takes them and Bobby to the world of H.P. Lovecraft, who supposedly wrote a manuscript describing Purgatory shortly before his death. They discover that Lovecraft invited guests for a first-hand look into another dimension during a dinner party, where all of them eventually ended up dead or insane. Sam begs Castiel for help, who is enraged that Crowley threatened Dean with his loved ones. Castiel still believes that he is doing the right thing and when Dean is nearly killed by a demon he is interrogating, Castiel saves him and kills the demon, promising to save Lisa and Ben but asking Dean to stand down which he refuses to do. Balthazar meets with Castiel; he knows Cas is in league with Crowley, but agrees to help Castiel to the end. Bobby speaks with the sole survivor of the Lovecraft party back in 1937 to know more details, but inadvertently finds out that the old man's mother is Ellie Visyak (who Dean acquired the dragon-slayer sword from back in "Like a Virgin"), who is actually immortal and originated in Purgatory. She explains to Bobby that she fell through the cracks from the opening of dimensions and has been hiding out on Earth ever since. She refuses to tell Bobby how to open the gate to Purgatory or accept his help to protect her. Meanwhile, the brothers get help from Balthazar who teleports them to where Lisa and Ben are held. Dean discovers that Lisa is possessed by a demon who stabs her body to convince Dean to stop the exorcism. However, Dean is undeterred and exorcises the demon. He then carries Lisa all the way outside, reunites with Sam and the group heads for hospital. Lisa is mortally wounded however and as Dean grieves as she lies dying, Castiel appears to help. As a final act of friendship with Dean, he heals Lisa's wounds without being asked and both he and Dean admit they wish this changed the fact that they are now enemies. As one last favor to Dean, Castiel erases Lisa and Ben's memories of Dean so they can live a safe, normal life. Later, Ellie prepares to leave her safehouse but Castiel arrives and captures her.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam is on the run from police. A bartender helps him investigate his loss of memory. Sam flashes to earlier memories where he is helping Dean and Bobby look for Ellie Visyak, who has been taken by Castiel. They eventually find her but she dies from her wounds while escaping from Crowley. Castiel shows up and breaks the wall in Sam's mind when they refuse to stop trying to stop him. In his mind, Sam fights a ruthless copy of himself (The soulless version from the beginning of the season), eventually winning, and absorbing his memories of the time he was soulless. In the real world, Balthazar betrays Castiel by giving up Crowley's hiding place to Dean and Bobby. Sam travels to Bobby's house in the dream world and meets a third Sam, who consists of the memories when he was in Lucifer's cage. "Tortured" Sam allows Sam to kill him, who then reintegrates into Sam's mind. Back in the real world, Castiel discovers Balthazar's treachery and kills him. Dean and Bobby arrive at Crowley's hideout but are attacked by a cloud of demons. Furious, Castiel tries to kill Crowley but discovers that he cannot. Crowley has allied with Raphael as Castiel betrayed him. Giving up Ellie's Purgatory blood, Castiel escapes, while Crowley recites the spell to open Purgatory with Raphael. Dean and Bobby recover and storm in but are both easily beaten by Crowley. As Crowley finishes the spell, nothing happens. Castiel had switched the jars of Purgatory blood, using the real one to open Purgatory and absorb every soul there. Now all powerful, Castiel destroys Raphael, while Crowley escapes. A recovered Sam arrives and stabs Cas with an angel's sword, but it has no effect. Castiel proclaims himself as the new God of the world, and tells the group to bow down and profess their love unto him their Lord or he shall destroy them.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Having gained an incredible increase in power by absorbing the souls of Purgatory (the afterlife of monsters) in the previous season finale, Castiel (Misha Collins) appoints himself the new God and sets out to right some of the wrongs in the world, but is increasingly disturbed by the entities from Purgatory that are proving difficult for him to control. Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki), Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles), and Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) enlist the help of the demon Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard) in securing a spell to summon Death (Julian Richings) and bind him to their will so that they can use him to stop Castiel. However, Castiel intervenes and breaks the binding spell. Death decides not to punish Sam, Dean, and Bobby for binding him and instead reveals to the group that the entities Castiel is struggling with are the Leviathans, God's first creations. They had been locked into Purgatory to prevent them from eating the rest of God's creations. After Castiel finds that he has lost control of himself and slaughtered a group of people under the control of the Leviathans, he goes to Sam, Dean, and Bobby for help, and they help him send all the souls he had consumed back into Purgatory. However, the Leviathans remain in Castiel's body and assume complete control, revealing that they have killed him from within. Meanwhile, Sam struggles throughout the episode with psychological fall-out of the "wall" in his mind that had been protecting him from his memories of torture at the hands of Lucifer and Michael in Hell, having been torn down by Castiel. Sam begins hallucinating and sees Lucifer (Mark Pellegrino), who tells him that he was never truly saved from Hell; what has transpired since the fifth season finale "Swan Song" is all an elaborate illusion controlled by Lucifer designed to psychologically torture Sam by giving him false hope before dashing it.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>The Leviathans realize that they can't stay in Castiel's rapidly destabilizing body and so walk his body into the local water supply and disperse there, possessing civilians who ingest or otherwise come into contact with the water. Seeking a steady food supply of humans, they infiltrate various human establishments. When Bobby responds to a distress-call from Sheriff Jody Mills (Kim Rhodes), he discovers that one of these places is Sioux Falls General. Meanwhile, Sam continues to see Lucifer and questions if the world he sees is real or if—as Lucifer claims—he is still in Hell. Lucifer urges Sam to kill himself in order to end the illusion, but Dean helps Sam overcome his hallucinations by distinguishing between the pain of real-life and the tortures of Hell. When the brothers return to Bobby's house, they find it burned to the ground with Bobby conspicuously absent, leading them to fear the worst. The Leviathan Edgar (Benito Martinez), having been sent to kill them and Bobby, attacks them and though they manage to temporarily stop him by crushing him under a car, Dean's leg is broken and Sam doesn't respond to Dean's frantic attempts to wake him up after Edgar knocks him out with a pipe. While being carted off in an ambulance, both brothers receive a shock: Sam is still seeing Lucifer and starts to seize, and Dean learns that the ambulance is taking them to Sioux Falls General Hospital.</p></div></div>

In that time, Sam has still suffered hallucinations, but has kept quiet about them. While collecting food, Sam discovers the return of an unknown serial killer and takes off on his own to find her. In truth, the killer is a Kitsune, a monster who removes the pituitary gland in the brain as nourishment. Sam eventually tracks down the monster as an old acquaintance, Amy Pond (Jewel Staite), who years ago he had a crush on while hunting Amy's mother. When Sam confronts Amy on the deaths, she reveals that she has a son who needed fresh meat in order to survive an illness brought on by harvesting dead bodies. As Amy had helped protect and defend Sam, even killing her own mother, Sam lets her go. Dean manages to catch up to Sam and get the truth to his disappearance, and urges Sam to find Amy and kill her. Sam refuses, and acknowledges Dean has been treating him like a hand grenade, and emphasizing that he is managing his hallucinations and atoning for his past actions. Dean agrees to stop badgering him, but later tracks and kills Amy in front of her son because he believes that Amy would have killed more humans in the future. Dean doesn't kill the son who hasn't killed anyone, but warns that if the son kills anyone, he will. The son promises that the only person he will kill is Dean. Throughout, the Leviathans are shown to maintain an eye on the various rocker aliases of the brothers, using the aliases to catch up to them.</p></div></div>

A god with nothing but revenge on his mind, Osiris is putting random people on trial for any mistakes they've made in the past and then promptly killing them if they're found guilty. Upon sensing Dean's guilt, Osiris puts him on trial with Sam becoming Dean's lawyer. But both Sam and Dean are stunned when Osiris calls a witness, someone they thought they'd never see again: Jo. Jo, however, tries to assure Dean he had nothing to do with her death. Osiris's second witness is Sam, and he also tries to convince Dean that he had nothing to do with how his life turned out. Sam then calls Dean to the stand, and Osiris then poses a question to him, "Does he (Dean) want Osiris to call the final witness? Or would he like to hear the verdict?" Dean chooses to hear the verdict, which stuns Sam, because he doesn't know who the last witness is. Osiris then turns Jo into a vengeful spirit and forces her to try to kill Dean, however, just before she can, Sam stabs Osiris with a ram's horn, thus saving Dean. The episode ends with Sam telling a quizzical Dean that although he (Sam) has done a lot of bad things, he has paid his dues (with Hell), hence feels no more guilt.</p></div></div>

Several of the crime scenes, however, contain ancient Romanian coins, acting as hexed objects. The brothers learn that each victim was connected to Donald Stark (James Marsters), a wealthy businessman, philanthropist and pillar of the community. While Donald assures the brothers that the business deal he and the victims were in had nothing to do with their deaths, Sam searches the house and discovers that Donald's wife, Maggie (Charisma Carpenter), is a powerful witch who is currently separating from Donald. In the process, though, Maggie is killing people connected to 'helping' Donald set up a fling with one of the victims. Heading to Maggie's house, Sam and Dean learn that Donald's personal assistant is next, and manage to save her before Maggie's curse kills her. Later on, however, it is revealed that Donald himself is a witch, as he uses his powers to destroy Maggie's auction paintings and decapitate her best friend. When Sam and Dean realize this, they wait for the two to meet at Donald's house, then try to kill them using a spell with chicken feet. The spell fails, and Sam suggests they counsel the witches on their failing marriage to prevent them from killing Dean and himself. Although they manage to counsel the witches, they are summarily thrown around and beaten for seeming to side with the other party, until Dean is able to say that Donald never tried to have a relationship with his receptionist. The two witches reconcile their love, and Sam and Dean leave with their lives. At the hotel, however, Sam and Dean are confronted by one of the Leviathans, who had been tracking them for days. After almost killing Sam, the Leviathan is rendered unconscious by a spell from Donald, who had dropped by to save the brothers' lives (initially) from Maggie's coin curses. Sam and Dean bind up the Leviathan for transport to Bobby's, in order to determine how to defeat the new monsters.</p></div></div>

Bobby tries to figure out a way to kill the Leviathans using the one they had captured, while Sam and Dean take refuge with a surveillance expert, who gives them temporary identities to evade authorities. The brothers try to stop the Leviathan pair and track them across the country, discovering that the Leviathans are committing the crimes in every town the brothers have visited since Sam left college. Meanwhile, Bobby continues in the course of finding a way to stop the Leviathans, discovers that decapitation works. However, with the head in close proximity, it eventually re-attaches itself to the torso. The brothers eventually find the Leviathans in Iowa but are arrested by local law enforcement. Bobby gets a visit from Sheriff Jody Mills, who offers to clean up the cabin and cook some food for Bobby. While cleaning, however, some soapy water spills onto the Leviathan, causing serious burns. Bobby gives the hostage Leviathan's severed head to Jody, telling her to dump it. Soon after, Dean, given a phone call, contacts Bobby and manages to learn how to at least stall the Leviathan. The local sheriff eventually helps Sam and Dean when he sees the Leviathan eating one of the officers and turning into Sam and Dean. Sam, in an interrogation room, is confronted by the Leviathan Dean, who reveals Dean's killing of the kitsune, Amy. Dean and the sheriff manage to decapitate the Sam Leviathan, and then the Dean Leviathan shortly after, keeping the heads with them to prevent re-attachment. Afterward, however, Sam confronts Dean about Amy's death, telling him he can't talk to him right now, leaves Dean and sets forth alone. Meanwhile, one of the Leviathans, disguised as an FBI agent, contacts his superior - a man named Dick Roman - about the recent failure. Crowley then appears to Dick in an effort to build a partnership, but Dick harshly turns Crowley down, considering demons to be even more pathetic than humans, and hinting that he wouldn't mind wiping them off the face of the Earth.</p></div></div>

Dean gets a text from Sam on his cell that asks him to come to a church, and finds that Sam is getting married to Becky Rosen. Dean is surprised and worried that Sam might not be thinking straight, but he also finds another piece of disturbing news; people in the town are dying "freaky deaths". As it turns out, Becky has been giving a love potion to Sam, obtained from a demon in disguise of a Wiccan, who is making deals and calling them in early. However, as this demon is making a deal with Becky, Sam, Dean and Garth come busting through the door. The demon is trapped, but reveals that he has a minion named Jackson who frees him and the two gain the upper hand until Becky manages to kill Jackson with Ruby's Knife, after which the Crossroads Demon is overpowered. Before Dean can kill him, Crowley arrives, having been alerted to the demon's plans by Jackson. He tells Dean that he will rip up any deals made by his rogue demon, and in exchange he wants to take the rogue demon back to hell "to make an example of him." He tells them about Dick Roman and the reason that they haven't recently faced any demons is because they have been too busy hunting down Leviathans, whom he has started to hate. In the aftermath, Sam and Becky get an annulment and Sam points her towards Garth as a new love interest.</p></div></div>

During their research, Dean tries a new Turducken burger at a local burger joint, after he and Sam interview the forest ranger, who seems rather unfazed about the recent killings. The three hunters decide to hunt down the creature, coming across the remains of another ranger who went missing recently. Calling in the 1st ranger, he is also taken by the mystery creature; the creature is eventually shot by Bobby. The hunters soon learn that the monster is actually a vicious, hyperadrenalized human-zombie. As they discover this finding, Dean exhibits similar 'stoned' symptoms as the forest ranger had. Eventually, Sam and Bobby realize that the cause behind Dean's mind-dulling (and that of most of the burger joint patrons) is the Turducken sandwich, which ends up secreting a grey substance similar to what was within the hyper-zombie. Following the meat to the supplier, the hunters inadvertently discover the base of operations for the Leviathans. It is discovered that the Leviathan were working on a food additive designed to render humans complacent and mindless, potentially for ease of world domination. However, the leader, Dick, appears and closes the project down because the adverse side effects - zombified humans - made headlines, which is something Dick wants to ensure does not happen to keep humans in the dark about their presence. He also dispatches the lead scientist Leviathan, Dr. Gaines, by placing a bib around his neck, and forces Dr. Gaines to eat himself. Bobby, watching everything, is then attacked by another Leviathan and brought to Dick, who reveals that he plans on eating Bobby in the future, but plans to use him to lure in Sam and Dean. The brothers break into the facility and free Bobby, spraying down the Leviathan with Borax to incapacitate and stall them. They then make their escape, with Dick attempting to shoot at the van.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Bobby spends the majority of the episode in a coma, making his way through a network of his own memories, while a reaper follows him in an attempt to secure Bobby's soul. Aided by a representation of his old friend Rufus, he learns that in order to break free of the dream state he must confront and relive his own worst experiences. It is revealed that shortly before he was forced to kill her, Bobby broke his wife's heart by refusing to have children, motivated by a fear of becoming like his own abusive father. Bobby is determined to get a cryptic combination of numbers to Sam and Dean in the real world, and eventually confronts his memory of the night he, as a child, shot and killed his violent father. Telling the memory of his father that he ended up with two wonderful sons and that he did not allow the childhood abuse to ruin his life, he manages to emerge from his coma long enough to write the numbers on Sam's hand, upon which his heart stops. Inside Bobby's head, he relives one last memory of a night with Sam and Dean as the dream world around him fades away, and the reaper tells him to make a choice: to let his life go, or stay, and become a ghost. The reaper's watch ticks ominously as the screen cuts to black.</p></div></div>

However, as they chase him down the alley, Dean accidentally "hitches a ride" on Cronos, who drags him back to 1944. While Dean pairs up with Eliot Ness (Nicholas Lea), who is a hunter as well, Sam pairs up with Sheriff Mills, in finding a way to bring Dean back to the present and kill Cronos. Dean is able to get a message to Sam. After tracking down the girl that Cronos fell in love with who's now an old woman, Sam and Mills learn that Cronos grabbed Dean and disappeared at 11:34, so they plan to summon him from that particular time. Dean and Eliot get a stake that can kill Cronos and reveal the truth to the woman he loves. Sam summons Cronos as he tries to kill Dean and Eliot tosses him the stake as he goes. In the present, Sam kills Cronos with the stake, but he warns that their future is filled with black ooze  and that the Leviathans are everywhere. He tells them to enjoy oblivion.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Four years ago, Sam and Dean helped a woman named Nora (Nicole Oliver) exorcise a demon in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho that was systematically killing women in a small town. They managed to save the postal worker, Jeffrey (Russell Sams), while vanquishing the demon. However, the return of the same M.O. of killings prompts the brothers to return to town to determine if the demon has returned. While investigating the murders, the brothers visit Jeffrey, whose life had taken a tailspin into a psych ward, though he is now in a halfway house under guardianship. Jeffrey remembers a list of women whom the demon decided to kill, and Dean leaves to find the demon's hideout, while Sam tries to keep an eye on the next victim. However, Sam starts to see Lucifer (Mark Pellegrino) again and continues to mock Sam, complaining about boredom and causing terrifying illusions to get Sam to talk to him. Dean and Jeffrey end up finding the demon's old hideout, as well as Nora's son, who is being held captive. It is revealed that Jeffrey, having harbored a serial killer nature, desperately wishes to reunite with the demon who possessed him so as to continue killing and becoming even more powerful, and required Dean's blood for the power summoning spell. Sam, eventually accepting Lucifer's help, finds this out by threatening Nora, who was forced to help Jeffrey when she learned her son was kidnapped. Jeffrey is successful in summoning the demon, though it chooses to possess Nora's son, stating that it succeeded in turning Jeffrey into a killer, and Jeffrey did not need him anymore. Sam intervenes and manages to trick the demon into stepping into a Devil's trap, while Dean kills Jeffrey, who was intending to stab the demon. Nora exorcises the demon from her son and the brothers return to the motel to rest. However, Lucifer appears again, and begins to force Sam to hallucinate hellfire, stating that by letting him help Sam, Lucifer now has a much firmer grip on Sam's mind.</p></div></div>

While collecting the slippers, Dean touches the slippers, and begins to be drawn to them, much to his embarrassment (as the slippers attracted those interested or practiced in ballet). Before the slippers take their hold, Sam and Dean find the antiques dealer who sold the slippers, and multiple empty curse boxes, as he had sold three other cursed objects. The brothers race to retrieve the cursed objects, although they fail to save one woman, who drinks steaming water from a cursed tea kettle and kills herself. After locking away the cursed objects, the dealer reveals that his mother collected the objects (presumably being a hunter), and was recently killed in a car crash after selling her store to a realtor named Joyce, who has recently been buying up several properties in town. Getting the paranoid Frank to dig into the company and its subsidiary, Dean discovers that it is a Leviathan front. Meanwhile, Sam, tired from forced sleep deprivation due to Lucifer haunting him, inadvertently attracts the attention of Joyce's assistant, George, while getting a coffee. George then follows Sam to the antiques dealer. The Leviathans then set up a trap, forcing the dealer to say he touched a cursed object to lure the brothers to the store. Once there, the monsters attack the brothers. However, George, tired of Joyce's belittling behavior and reckless impatience, subtly aids Sam and Dean in beheading Joyce, gleefully planning to eat her. Due to their shock, George briefly describes to the brothers that the only real way to kill a Leviathan was to eat them (or force them to eat themselves, via 'bibbing') and that in this situation, he means them and the people of the town no harm. Sam and Dean then discover that the properties were bought to make way for a research center dedicated to curing cancer, bewildering them as to why the Leviathans would be helping humans. Heading to Frank's trailer with the cursed objects, the brothers find the trailer wrecked on the inside, with blood sprayed everywhere.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Lucifer has driven Sam to the point of mental breakdown, because of which he is now committed to a mental institution. Dean promises Sam to find a cure to this illness and calls every hunter in the diary. However, no hunter is able to help him. When he gets up, and moves to get a beer, the diary is thrown onto the floor and a card falls from it, with a number of the hunter who can help him. The hunter eventually leads Dean to a faith healer named Emanuel, who fixed his injuries and encourages Dean to get in touch with him. When Dean goes to meet with Emanuel, he finds that the Demons are also interested in this healer, and are searching for him. Eventually, when Dean does find Emanuel he discovers him to be Castiel. Castiel has no memory of his past life as an angel and now works as a faith healer. Dean convinces him to come with him to heal Sam of his mental break down. However, along the way, Meg shows up and asks to be a part of the trip. Once they reach the hospital, they find it covered by demons. Castiel kills the demons, and along the way, gains back his memories. However, the guilt of his actions make him leave. Dean stops him and convinces him to try and save Sam. While in the hospital, Sam meets with a woman, who is haunted by the ghost of her dead brother. Her brother is stuck on Earth and cannot move to his afterlife. Sam asks this woman if she has any of her brother's objects. She tells him about her bracelet, which has his blood on it. Sam asks the woman to create a circle of salt. While they are in it and about to burn the bracelet, her brother shows up and is about to harm them. Sam then burns the bracelet, giving the girl freedom from her brother's ghost. However, his actions lead to him being taken for electroshock therapy where the orderly turns out to be a demon who tortures him. Castiel finds him in time to save him, but fails to heal him. He does the next best thing: transfers Sam's madness and experience in Hell, to himself. So while Sam is released, Castiel stays in the hospital plagued with the visions of Lucifer. Meg takes up a job in the hospital, to support Castiel, and look after him.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>The episode begins with a death/murder of a teen, caused by an unknown monster in Junction City, Kansas. Then a hunter (Garth) (DJ Qualls) is shown getting out of his car. Garth at first believes it's the ghost of a local legend and torches her bones, however, to his surprise, there is still another dead body reported, hence he decides to call Dean for help. Dean is surprised when he gets a call from Garth asking for the brothers’ help on a case. Sam, Dean and Garth investigate the case, and find out through a translator that the monster is targeting the children of the owners of a local brewery. They find out that the owners had removed one of their partners, who wasn't in favor of selling the brewery. This partner, Dale, had literally been the brain behind the company, and loved the company like his own child and upon being removed from his position, had taken his own life. They then find out, that before he died, Dale had harnessed a Shōjō (猩猩, a Japanese Sea Spirit), by placing it in a spell box and sending it as an apology to his old partners, making sure that once the box was open, the Shōjō would kill their children. Eventually, Dean kills the Shōjō, with a blessed (by a procedure carried out at the back of a restaurant), samurai blade. Another important story is that of Bobby's ghost. Bobby has been making his presence felt in the last few episodes, first by dropping the card that led Dean to the hunter who knew Castiel/Emanuel, and from then on helping Dean whenever he gets stuck. For instance, when the Shōjō knocks the blade out of Dean's hand, it immediately glides back into his hand. Sam tells him it's just his mind playing tricks on him, as Sam had done a Ouija Board, and had no response. However, Garth, Dean and Sam both find that whenever an EMF meter is put next to Dean, it lights up. Eventually, when they are about to leave the motel they were staying in, Dean goes back to get Bobby's flask that he left behind. It is then shown that Bobby is present through the flask, but Dean's inability to see him saddens him greatly.</p></div></div>

When they arrive in town, they find out Annie has disappeared. They trace her last whereabouts to an old abandoned house that is haunted by a powerful ghost. Unknown to them, the ghost of Bobby is following them around, having tied himself to his old flask that they carry. He finds the house populated by mostly mindless ghosts and the spirit of Whitman Van Ness. Bobby discovers the ghost of Annie and the two try to solve the murders. They discover that Van Ness murdered all these people and trapped them in the house, but Bobby gets pulled away when the boys leave before he can learn anything else. Having finally learned how to properly use his ghostly abilities from an arrogant ghost named Haskel Crane, Bobby is able to leave Sam and Dean a message that Annie is trapped and that he is still with them. They return to the house where the ghost of a prostitute named Victoria lets them know about Van Ness before he destroys her. Sam and Dean head off to find and destroy Van Ness' bones with the ghost following them after he ties himself to an object he places in Sam's pocket. Bobby and Annie manage to discover the bodies of all the victims and plan to burn them to put the ghosts to rest. However, after Van Ness attacks them, Dean destroys the object and Van Ness returns to his house where he tries to destroy and absorb Bobby. Just in time, Dean burns Van Ness' bones, destroying him. They return to the house where Bobby is now visible to the Winchesters. Bobby leads them to the remains of Van Ness' victims, including Annie, and they burn them, putting them all to rest. Dean, however, is furious that Bobby stayed as it's unnatural and he should've moved on. Bobby, furious, disappears, but listens invisibly in the boys' backseat as they discuss the situation, unsure how to handle it and how it will turn out.</p></div></div>

As Charlie hacks the drive, it automatically sends an email to the brothers letting them know what happened and its location from a GPS tracker on it. Charlie successfully hacks the drive, but learns the truth about the Leviathans and Roman from reading Frank's files on them and then witnessing her boss, Pete (David Stuart), get eaten and replaced by a Leviathan. She runs from her job and encounters Sam and Dean who track her down and they team up together to have Charlie infiltrate Dick Roman Enterprises, erase Frank's drive and hack Dick's files so they can learn his plans. She succeeds, learning that what Dick had recently been looking for in archeological sites has been found and Sam and Dean retrieve it and replace it with a Borax bomb. Dick realizes her betrayal and attacks her, but Bobby (who tagged along with her through his flask) and the boys rescue her, but Bobby attacks Dick and displays signs of becoming a vengeful spirit worrying Sam and Dean as there's no returning from that.

Castiel explains the tablet they found inside the clay is the Word of God, information from God written out on a tablet by Metatron, the celestial scribe, but he lacks the ability to read it. At the same time, Kevin is driven to drive to the hospital where he steals the tablet before Sam catches him while Dean tries and fails to get answers from Castiel. Kevin displays the ability to read the tablet which contains information about the Leviathans, but has a hard time with it and two angels arrive to take him away, explaining that he is a Prophet chosen to interpret the Word and that he needs to be taken away to learn to do that. When they try to kill Sam and Meg, Castiel intervenes, but when they still refuse to stop, Dean banishes all three angels. The group make their way to Rufus' Cabin where they ward themselves from angels and have Kevin set to work on translating the tablet while Meg sneaks out and kills two demons that followed them. This draws the angels' attention, but when one tries to kill Castiel, Meg kills her. The other angel allows Kevin to finish the translation before taking him away, but upon his return home, the two angels with him are killed by a Leviathan waiting for him. Sam and Dean discover that the tablet contains instructions on how to kill a Leviathan: "a bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen." The first is a fallen angel and Castiel gives them a vial of his blood before disappearing.</p></div></div>

Along the way, they learn that the domesticating substance has been added to corn syrup and is now everywhere, with people now acting very dumb. Arriving at the location Crowley gave them, they find a bunch of vampires dead from feeding on infected humans and a young woman named Emily who claims that the Alpha kidnapped her as a little girl.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Dick speaks to Crowley about a deal: in exchange for giving the Winchesters the wrong blood, Dick will give him and his demons Canada to do whatever they want with as long as they leave America alone. After going through an extensive contract, the deal is struck. At the same time, Sam and Dean break into the crypt of a group of nuns and steal a bone of one they feel is righteous enough for the weapon. Hacking into Sucrocorp's security cameras using what Charlie taught them, Sam and Dean spy on Dick, but discover that through the arm of the real Dick Roman, he has had many other Leviathans take on his form in order to protect himself and they can't tell which is which. Bobby, still possessing the maid arrives to get his revenge on Dick and when Sam tries to stop him, nearly strangles him to death before he regains control of himself and leaves the maid's body. At the same time, Kevin breaks free and discovers that Dick plans to poison creamers to kill off all skinny people, but is recaptured afterwards. Sam and Dean unsuccessfully summon Crowley while Meg arrives with Castiel who reveals that he discovered that his entire garrison has been destroyed and if any angels have survived, they are in hiding. Crowley arrives and is furious to see Castiel, but after realizing he's insane, gives them his blood and explains the deal Dick made with him, assuring them that this is really his blood. He also reveals that Cas, who refuses to fight anymore, can help them kill Dick. Castiel refuses to help and after he disappears to get the game Twister, Meg explains that due to him having the Leviathans inside of him, Castiel is able to tell them apart and will be able to identify the real Dick Roman. Bobby returns, but is now having trouble controlling himself and asks Sam and Dean to burn his flask. They do so, promising Bobby that they will finish Dick, but not out of vengeance. Afterwards, Castiel agrees to help and Dean has Meg crash the Impala into Sucrocorp to attract the guards' attention while he, Sam and Castiel sneak in. Meg decapitates the guards, but is captured by demons working for Crowley. Sam rescues Kevin who explains to him Dick's plan to kill the skinny people and the two head off to blow up the lab. Dean and Castiel confront Dick in the lab, but when Dean stabs him through the heart with the weapon, it fails to kill him. However, Dean reveals this to be a trick and while Castiel holds Dick in place from behind, stabs Dick through the neck with the weapon, killing him. However, Dean and Castiel disappear and Crowley betrays Sam, taking Kevin and planning to become the next major threat. Crowley also has an army of demons in the building dealing with the remaining Leviathans located there now that Dick is dead. Dean and Castiel find themselves in Purgatory surrounded by monsters and Castiel disappears on Dean.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>A year after he was sucked into Purgatory, the afterlife of monsters, Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) finally escapes with the help of a vampire named Benny Lafitte (Ty Olsson). As part of their deal, Dean smuggles Benny's soul out of Purgatory and resurrects him before they go their separate ways; Dean's friend Castiel (Misha Collins), who had been trapped in Purgatory with him in the previous season finale, is conspicuously absent and Dean later reveals that the angel did not make it out of Purgatory with him and Benny. Dean travels to the safe house in Whitefish, Montana, where he meets up with his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki), who he learns had given up the "family business" of hunting monsters to lead a normal life with a dog and a girlfriend named Amelia Richardson (Liane Balaban) while Dean was gone. Tension springs up between the brothers because Sam did not even try to save him, Castiel, or the prophet under their protection, teenager Kevin Tran (Osric Chau) who had been kidnapped a year ago by the demon Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard). When Dean checks Sam's discarded phones, he discovers that Kevin has in fact escaped from Crowley on his own and is now on the run, and he and Sam track him down. Kevin explains that Crowley took him to make him translate the Word of God tablet about demons and help him unleash all demons onto Earth, but that he had managed to escape with the tablet, which he has hidden elsewhere for safe-keeping. He also reveals that the tablet has a way to send all demons to Hell and lock them away forever. The Winchesters immediately want to find the tablet and use the spell to banish the demons, but are interrupted by the arrival of demons who have been following them to find Kevin, including Crowley himself, who is being accompanied by Kevin's possessed girlfriend, Channing Ngo (Lissa Neptuno). Crowley demands that Kevin come with him and return the tablet, but Kevin once again outwits him and escapes with the Winchesters. Crowley then murders Channing to spite Kevin. The episode ends with Dean receiving a secret call from Benny, who seems to be questioning life outside of Purgatory. The two try to maintain some distance from each other, but Dean tells Benny he should call in an emergency.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Kevin demands that Sam and Dean take him to his mother, Linda Tran (Lauren Tom), to make sure she is safe. They find that she is being watched by demons, and kill the demons and rescue her. The group then goes to retrieve the tablet Kevin hid, only to find that it has been stolen by Plutus (Gerard Plunkett), who is auctioning it off along with other rare supernatural items. Sam, Dean, Kevin, and Linda attend the auction to find a way to get it back. Crowley comes to the auction as well, also seeking the tablet. When the tablet and prophet Kevin (who is involuntarily included in the auction to raise bids) are sold to Linda for the price of her soul, Crowley possesses her and steals the tablet. He is forced to flee her body when Dean comes close to killing him, but still manages to get away with the tablet. Angry that Dean tried to kill his mother, Kevin decides to take his mother and leave for fear that their association with the Winchesters will get them killed. Meanwhile, Dean has recollections from his time in Purgatory: after much searching, he and Benny locate Castiel. Benny demands to know why Castiel had abandoned Dean when the two of them first landed in Purgatory, and Castiel reveals that it had been to keep the leviathan hunting him away from Dean. Though Castiel warns Dean that he should stay away from him, Dean is adamant that he won't leave without Castiel and the three of them start to look for the way out of Purgatory. However, the last shot of the episode is a disconcerting flashback of a screaming Castiel being left behind at the portal out of Purgatory.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Although Sam wants to focus on finding Kevin and the demon tablet, Dean suggests that they take on a case involving a murderer taking a human heart every six months. Tracking down the crimes from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Boulder, Colorado, the Winchesters discover that all the murders were committed by different people, all with no prior history of violence, and that each likely suspect had an alibi for the other murders. After one of their suspects (Paul Boyle) stabs himself in the eye, Dean learns that each killer had received an organ transplant from the recently deceased athlete Brick Holmes. The Winchesters also learn that "Brick" was actually a Mayan athlete who had made a deal with an ancient god to live forever and excel at various sports under different aliases over the centuries in exchange for sacrifices of human hearts each year. When Brick fell in love with a mortal woman (Patty McCormack) in the 1940s, they stayed together even after she became so old she had to pose as his mother. Eventually, he committed suicide because he couldn't stand the thought of living without her. The recipients of his organs enjoy the power they are suddenly bestowed with and are eager to carry out the murders to fulfill Brick's deal with the god. Brick's wife tells the brothers that they must destroy Brick's heart to end the murders. Upon tracking down the woman who received Brick's heart (Kyra Zagorsky), Sam and Dean stab her in the heart, sparking a chain reaction that results in the deaths of not only the woman but also the recipients of Brick's other organs. Meanwhile, Sam contemplates returning to normal life after they have sealed the gates of Hell, though Dean, having come to re-embrace and enjoy the violence of hunting while in Purgatory, refuses to entertain the notion and wants to keep hunting with Sam.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Most of the episode is presented as found footage from the perspective of three film school students: Brian (Leigh Parker), Michael (Brandon W. Jones), and Kate (Brit Sheridan). The episode starts with Sam and Dean finding the footage edited into a movie and waiting to be played for them in the middle of a crime scene at the students' home where there are two unidentifiable bodies. They watch the movie. Brian and Michael had begun making it to depict the details of their lives in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Michael is bitten by a mysterious creature and begins exhibiting supernatural traits. Things get out of hand when he kills a bully (Eric Banerd) in a fit of rage for threatening Kate. Trying to find out what's happening to him, Michael, Brian, and Kate spy on Sam and Dean, who are trying to find a werewolf who's been biting and killing people at the college Brian, Michael, and Kate attend; this werewolf, Sam and Dean reveal, is a "pureblood" werewolf that possesses some unique qualities, including retaining a greater degree of awareness when it transforms than other werewolves. Brian privately realizes that the pure-blood werewolf is one of his professors (David Lewis) and blackmails him into turning him into a werewolf, too. He tells the horrified Michael and Kate what he's done, revealing that he did it because he is jealous of Michael for having power and Kate's love. Brian and Michael fight and Brian kills Michael in the struggle before turning Kate into a werewolf against her will so that they can be together. However, a vengeful Kate kills Brian instead; the two bodies Sam and Dean found at the house are Brian and Michael. Kate edits all their footage together into a movie for Sam and Dean to watch and understand what happened, finishing with a promise that she will feed off of animal hearts and not harm humans, asking for a chance to live in peace. At that point, Sam and Dean (having killed Brian's professor before tracing one of Brian's cameras to the students' home at the start of the episode) finish watching the video. Because Kate is a pureblood werewolf who can control herself and hasn't hurt anyone human, Sam and Dean agree to give her the chance she asked for.</p></div></div>

Dean immediately leaves to meet with Benny at Eagle Harbor in Bainbridge Island, Washington, though tells a confused Sam that he needs to take a day off and deal with some "personal" issues. After Dean meets with Benny and gives him blood bags to help him heal, Benny confesses that he is going after his Maker (Patrick Stafford) to get revenge. Fifty years earlier, Benny had fallen in love with a human, Andrea, and had left the vampire nest for her, but his Maker had killed him and told him he was going to rip Andrea's throat out. Dean agrees to help Benny and remembers the times Benny helped him and Castiel in Purgatory killing monsters as well as Leviathans. Meanwhile, Sam thinks about his time with Amelia and more about how they got together is shown. When Andrea is revealed to have become a vampire and Benny is captured, Dean calls Sam for help. Dean and Benny kill the vampires and Benny's Maker while Sam is on his way. Andrea helps Benny, but it is revealed that she simply wants to take over and Dean kills her before she can harm Benny, devastating Benny. Later, Sam meets Benny for the first time, and upon realizing that he is not human, Sam has a difficult time not trying to kill Benny.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>During the investigation of a murder in Kearney, Missouri, in which a wife killed her husband for an incident from 30 years earlier, Sam and Dean run into fellow hunter Garth. They learn that Garth has stepped into Bobby's role, organizing and leading hunters over the past year. Teaming up with him, they investigate the case. During the investigation, more murders occur over seemingly small incidents, leading the Winchesters and Garth to discover that the murderers are possessed by a specter, similar to a ghost, but possessing people to get revenge for them rather than its own gain. The specter does this through people touching an old penny. Dean, angry with Garth for doing and saying things Bobby would say (such as using his catch-phrase "idjits" and wearing Bobby's hat) eventually lashes out at Garth. Meanwhile, in flashbacks viewers learn that Sam's former lover, Amelia, lost her husband Don, and the two begin a relationship. Eventually, the specter forces Dean to touch the penny, which leads Dean to want to kill Sam for not searching for him over the last year. Garth breaks the Winchester brothers up by taking the coin from Dean and burning the coin to destroy the specter. Because Garth is a naturally passive person with no wishes for revenge in life, the penny has no effect on him. The episode ends with Dean seeing Garth off, giving him back Bobby's old hat. Sam later tells Dean off about his grudge, warning him that if he can't let go of his anger, Sam will leave.</p></div></div>

After Sam and Dean investigate a series of demon abductions, a weakened Castiel appears to them with no memory of how he escaped Purgatory. The abductions turn out to be known future prophets, as only one prophet can exist at a time, meaning that one of them will become the new prophet if Kevin dies. Dean has flashbacks of his escape from Purgatory and deals with his guilt for not saving Castiel. Meanwhile, Kevin is tortured by Crowley into translating the tablet and reveals to Crowley that there are more tablets. Sam, Dean, and Castiel intervene and save Kevin from Crowley. Castiel breaks the tablet in two pieces and Crowley flees, taking one half of the tablet with him. Kevin and the remaining prophets are rescued. Castiel reveals that he chose not to leave Purgatory with Dean, telling Dean that remaining in Purgatory was his penance for his previous actions. Dean is distressed to learn that Castiel stayed behind of his own volition. Castiel then "checks in" with a mysterious angel named Naomi (Amanda Tapping), who asks about Sam and Dean and tells him that an army of angels rescued him from Purgatory and that he will not remember these periodic check-ins.</p></div></div>

Meanwhile, Dean and Castiel have a heart-to-heart about Castiel's mental state and the ramifications of his actions as "God." The Winchesters and Cas determine that the cartoonish effects are caused by an old man, named Fred Jones (Mike Farrell), who has reality warping powers, and is currently living in a dream world inside his mind while residing in an assisted care facility. Fred is being used by a doctor at the assisted care facility to rob other elderly patients of their valuables. While Dean confronts the doctor, Sam and Castiel enter Fred's mind to speak to him. Sam is able to convince Fred to give up living in a dream world and come back to reality, causing the reality warping effects to end. Fred forces the doctor to kill himself and has Castiel remove his powers so he is no longer a threat even though it leaves him in a mentally damaged state. Castiel decides to return to Heaven to face up to his actions, but is forbidden from doing so by Naomi. Instead, Castiel decides to watch over Fred for a while. In flashbacks, Sam meets Amelia's father who is initially cold towards him, but eventually warms up to him just in time for Amelia to learn that her husband is still alive.</p></div></div>

While following Benny, Martin finds an apparent victim of Benny's and calls Sam. Dean refuses to believe that Benny did it and sets out for Louisiana to find Benny. When Dean finds Benny, he is burying another victim and claims that it is a rogue vampire, named Desmond, who is trying to draw Benny back into the fold by killing a victim each time he refuses. While Dean believes Benny, who is staying in the area as it is his hometown and to look after his great-granddaughter Elizabeth, Sam and Martin refuse to believe him, and Martin knocks out Dean and he and Sam take off to hunt Benny. Before finding Benny, Sam gets a distress text from Amelia and takes off for Texas to find her, leaving Martin alone while Dean teams up with Benny to kill Desmond. Benny's story is proven to be true when Desmond attacks and nearly kills Dean, but Benny saves Dean and kills Desmond. Benny and Dean leave, but Martin, who is mentally unstable and refuses to give up the hunt, takes Elizabeth hostage and forces Benny to return so he can kill him. Elizabeth calls Dean who returns to find that Benny is gone and Martin is dead. In flashbacks, Sam is shown leaving Amelia to give her a chance with her husband Don. Upon returning to Texas, he finds Amelia fine and living with her husband, and realizes that Dean tricked him to get him out of the way, a realization that greatly upsets him.</p></div></div>

Dean chooses to leave instead and is contacted by Benny, who talks to Dean about Martin's death in the previous episode and asks Dean to come see him and lend him moral support, as Benny is having a difficult time managing life on Earth alone. Dean agrees to come see him as soon as he can. Meanwhile, having spotted Sam at the end of the previous episode, Amelia comes to his motel room and they end up having sex. They discuss their feelings for each other and, tired of her uncertainty in her relationship with Sam, Amelia proposes a test to settle things once and for all: if they both show up at the same place in two days, they will continue their relationship, even though that means Amelia will have to leave her husband; if they're not both there, they know their relationship is over for good. At the same time, the angel Samandriel (Tyler Johnston), who is being held captive and tortured by Crowley's forces, sends out a distress call to Naomi and Naomi sends Castiel to rescue him. Castiel asks Dean for help and they track Samandriel to Geneva, Nebraska. As they are outnumbered, Castiel goes against Dean's wishes by bringing in a reluctant Sam to help. The group assaults Crowley's base and rescues Samandriel, but not before Samandriel's unintentionally reveals to Crowley that there is a tablet about angels. Samandriel tries to warn Castiel about their superiors controlling them and Castiel has a flashback of Naomi apparently lobotomizing him, but at that point an agitated Naomi forces Castiel to kill Samandriel for telling Crowley about the angel tablet. After the rescue, Sam ultimately decides to not renew his relationship with Amelia and Dean likewise cuts off future contact with Benny so that they can re-commit themselves to their relationship with each other and their mission of sealing the gates of Hell.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In 1958, a man travels to a secret gentleman's club for initiation into the secret order, but finds the members there being slaughtered by the demon Abaddon (Alaina Huffman). When he is given a mysterious box to protect from her, the man uses a spell to travel forward in time and arrives in Sam and Dean's motel room in the present, demanding to see John Winchester. All three of them are forced to flee after Abaddon follows the man into the present and Ruby's knife fails to work on her. To Sam and Dean's surprise, the man explains that he is Henry Winchester (Gil McKinney), their long-absent grandfather, and he is part of a secret order known as the Men of Letters, who record and guard supernatural secrets. Shocked that John is dead and that Sam and Dean are oblivious to their family legacy as Men of Letters, Henry clashes with Dean. After he reads about his son's bleak life from his journal, he attempts to return to his time to prevent any of it from happening, but is foiled by Dean, who fears what the consequences would be for him and Sam if Henry changed the past. Meanwhile, Sam learns from the only surviving member of the order (George Touliatos) that the box contains a key to the greatest storehouse of supernatural knowledge ever known. Unfortunately, it is at that point that Abaddon reveals herself, kills the surviving Man of Letters, and takes Sam hostage, forcing Dean to do a trade: the key and Henry for Sam. After Dean gives Henry and the key to Abaddon, she fatally wounds Henry, but, having planned for this with Dean on their way to the exchange, he shoots her in the head with a bullet engraved with a devil's trap—a symbol that prevents demons from leaving the symbol or using their powers—thus binding her in place and within her body. Dean then decapitates her; unable to kill her, he plans instead to dismember her and bury the pieces to keep her incapacitated indefinitely. Henry dies in his grandsons' arms while making his peace with them. They bury him near his dead friends from the order and contemplate their family's history and how they are now the keepers of the storehouse, if it still exists.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In Belarus, a giant man decimates a Nazi concentration camp while the camp guards desperately try to stop him. The Commandant, Eckhart, casts a spell to escape that burns down the camp and a briefcase the Nazis were trying to protect. In the present, a rabbi, Rabbi Bass (Hal Linden), searches through a college library and finds a book that scares him. He makes a phone call before a mysterious man following him causes him to spontaneously combust. At the same time, Sam and Dean find the abandoned—but still intact—storehouse of the Men of Letters, in Lebanon, Kansas. After two weeks there, Sam discovers the death of Rabbi Bass in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and that he was a member of a secret order of rabbis, called the Judah Initiative, that worked with the Men of Letters during World War II, and they decide to investigate his death. Sam and Dean find themselves followed by the man that decimated the camp, but a young man named Aaron stops him. Aaron is Rabbi Bass' grandson and the last surviving descendant of the Judah Initiative. He was sent the man, a Golem (John DeSantis), after his grandfather died, but lacks the knowledge of how to properly control him. Sam and Dean learn that Rabbi Bass always told tales of battling a society of Nazi necromancers, called the Thule Society, and find the book Rabbi Bass had found and hidden for Aaron. The man who killed Rabbi Bass attacks Sam and Aaron and nearly kills them before the Golem kills him. The group learns the book is the Red Ledger, a logbook of ultimately successful experiments that the Thule performed to learn how to resurrect people. Eckhart and three Thule arrive, disable the Golem, and take back the Ledger. Eckhart reveals to Aaron how to take full control of the Golem, but before he can kill Aaron and the Winchesters, Aaron creates a distraction that allows Sam and Dean to kill two of the Thule. Eckhart then taunts them with the fact that the Thule can't be stopped, and they kill him. After disposing of the Thule bodies, Aaron takes full control of the Golem to continue the fight against the Thule, and Sam and Dean return to the storehouse, where Sam catalogs the Red Ledger, taking on the duties of a Man of Letters.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean have moved into the Men of Letters bunker. After weeks of work, Kevin finally cracks the instructions on how to close the Gates of Hell and calls Sam and Dean. Kevin states that in order to close the gates, someone must complete three trials. The first trial is to kill a hellhound, bathe in its blood, and recite a spell. The same spell is recited after the completion of each trial. Deciding to track down a hellhound, Sam identifies the Cassity family in Shoshone, Idaho, who, ten years ago, struck oil where there should be none, indicating they made a deal with a Crossroads Demon. At the Cassity farm, Sam and Dean take jobs, while keeping an eye on the family, with the intent of killing the hellhound sent to collect the person's soul. Believing it to be the owner, Alice, Sam and Dean miss the hellhound, who kills Alice's husband, Carl, who they learn made a deal with a demon to get Alice to fall in love with him. Realizing that there is still someone else who made a crossroads deal, Sam and Dean remain so that they don't have to start over. Kevin calls and tells them that only the damned, or an item scorched by holy fire, can see a hellhound, leading Dean to find glasses he can wave in a fire made with holy oil. The whole Cassity family arrives to comfort Alice. While Dean tries to find the hellhound, Sam focuses on finding which one of the bickering family members made the deal. Along the way, Sam learns that the deal was made with Crowley himself. Eventually, while trying to hunt what she believes is a wolf that killed Carl, Margot, the youngest family member, is killed by the hellhound, and it is discovered that she believed her family would be happy if they struck oil. The hellhound continues to hunt around the house, indicating that someone else made a deal, as well. Dean learns that the ranch manager Ellie (Danay García) made a deal to save her mother from Parkinson's disease when she was 15. Dean battles the hellhound when it goes after Ellie, but when he fails, Sam kills it and is coated in its blood, making him the one to complete the trials. Sam and Dean give Ellie a hexbag and send her on the run from Crowley, believing that if she keeps hidden, Crowley won't be able to send another hellhound to kill her. After convincing Dean that there is hope for life to continue after Hell is closed, instead of it being a suicide mission like he believes, Sam casts the spell needed to start closing the gates.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam and Dean receive a text from James Frampton (portrayed by Christian Campbell), a cop who helped them on a previous case, asking for their help. Traveling to St. Louis, Missouri, they learn that James has become a witch since they last met and is using magic to solve cases as a police officer. Sam and Dean are unhappy due to their previous encounters with witches, but decide to give him a chance. James' familiar, Portia (portrayed by Mishael Morgan) approaches the Winchesters, revealing that she sent the text, and stating that James is having dreams of killing people who, in reality, are actually dying. Though Dean wants to kill James, Sam convinces him to investigate first, convinced that someone might be committing the murders and placing the memories in James' mind. Sam and Dean chain James down, but while having sex with Portia, who he is in a relationship with, James opens his mind to her. Portia sees his dreams and realizes that all he is seeing are the murders, with no intent or planning to it, and convinces Sam and Dean that James must be innocent. Dean finds a spell in Bobby's notes that a witch could be using to implant false memories in James' mind. Realizing that the police detective investigating the case, Ed Stoltz, is hiding something, Sam, Dean, and James use astral projection to visit the station and discover that Stoltz, who has a grudge against James, is building a case against him using the familiar of another witch as a witness. James questions the familiar, who admits that he was doing so on his master, Spencer's, orders. Spencer kills his familiar and reveals he was jealous of James and Portia, wanting her as his familiar and lover. James battles Spencer to no avail, but when Portia creates a distraction, Sam and Dean kill Spencer with a witch-killing spell from Bobby's notes. James and Portia decide to leave town and start a new life together, rather than fight the case building against him. Dean finally decides to trust Sam's judgment, realizing that Sam can handle the trials after being reminded how important family is due to a psychic attack Spencer inflicted on Sam. However, Sam starts coughing up blood, an indicator that something is seriously wrong with him, which he does not share with his brother.</p></div></div>

The next morning, after being found by a deputy, the man comes back to life, heals himself, and leaves. Sam and Dean, waiting for Kevin to call with the next trial, find out about the apparent zombie from a magazine, and head off to investigate. The man is found dead, again, of a bear attack, and while Sam and Dean are visiting, he comes to life again and they take him with them to determine what's going on. The man, who tells them to call him Shane, explains that after an avalanche seven years earlier, he dies every day, comes back to life, and has no memory of his life before the avalanche. After a mysterious woman attacks him, Sam and Dean realize that Shane is actually the Greek Titan Prometheus who is cursed to die every day as punishment from Zeus for giving mankind back the gift of fire. The woman is the Greek goddess Artemis, who is hunting him down. Things get complicated when a young woman, named Hayley, shows up with a young boy, named Oliver, who is Prometheus' son and has the same curse. In order to free both, Sam and Dean decide to summon Zeus and force him to break the curse, learning how to trap and kill him from the Men of Letters books. Zeus tricks Hayley into freeing him from the trap and then proceeds to torture Prometheus, planning to kill him and Oliver over and over again to make him pay eternally for what he did. Sam and Dean convince Artemis to intervene, as she is secretly in love with Prometheus, and she tries to shoot her father with one of her arrows, which can kill a god. Zeus uses Prometheus as a shield, but Prometheus pushes the arrow through himself and into Zeus, killing him. Prometheus dies permanently, and with Zeus dead, the curse on Oliver is broken. Sam and Dean cremate Prometheus and Dean prays to Castiel to look after Sam who he knows is not doing as well as he pretends. Despite Dean's pleas, Castiel does not appear.</p></div></div>

At the same time, Sam and Dean find a case where people die of having their eyes burned out and organs liquefied and checking it out, discover that all of the people were possessed and digging for something. Trying to find out what the demons are looking for, they find out that Castiel is looking, too, and is in fact the one killing the people. Per Naomi's command, Castiel lies about what he and the demons are trying to find, causing Sam and Dean to become suspicious of him when they discover the truth. The trio finds and rescues Meg (Rachel Miner), revealed to be the one who knows where the crypts are, from Crowley, who has been torturing her for the crypts' locations. Meg brings Sam, Dean, and Castiel to the right crypt, and later sacrifices herself to hold Crowley off. Meanwhile, Dean and Castiel find the tablet in the crypt. Resisting Naomi's orders to kill Dean, Castiel ultimately breaks free of her control, and leaves with the tablet to keep it safe from everyone. Dean, having learned the truth about Sam's illness from Castiel, tells Sam to stop pretending and that he will help him carry the burden.</p></div></div>

The kids, Krissy, Aiden and Josephine have lost their families to a nest of vampires they are hunting and they live under the protection of an adult hunter named Victor who is training them while letting them also live a normal life. However, Dean grows suspicious as one of the vampires acts out of character and claims innocence. Investigating, Dean finds evidence that the vampire can't have been turned more than a few weeks before and is thus innocent and searching for the nest, he finds a vampire that the kids were sent after that supposedly killed Krissy's father, but has just been turned. Sam and Dean realize that Victor has been trying to create the next generation of hunters by hiring a vampire to kill their families and turn people so they can get "revenge." Victor kidnaps Sam after he figures it out and in the confrontation that follows when Dean and the kids return, Krissy manages to take down the vampire with dead man's blood and Victor kills himself when he realizes that he is going to be left alone. Using the vampire's blood, the group is able to turn the last victim back to human using the cure from "Live Free or Twihard" and the kids decide to stay together and be hunters, protecting the town they live in, but not actively seeking out threats. While Sam and Dean accept this, it just increases Dean's determination to close the gates of Hell as the kids are in serious danger as hunters as long as they are open.</p></div></div>

Torturing a Crossroads Demon, they learn that a rogue Reaper can take mortals and souls in and out of Heaven and Hell for a price and track down Ajay (Assaf Cohen), who reveals that he took Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) to Hell on Crowley's orders when his flask was burned. Sam heads to Hell with Ajay on a mission to rescue Bobby while Dean is forced to stay behind and deal with an unnerved Kevin who hides his half of the tablet. Ajay takes Sam to Purgatory where a back door to Hell exists and tells him to meet him in twenty-four hours, but Crowley learns of this and kills Ajay. Sam manages to rescue Bobby, but the two are stranded in Purgatory without Ajay to bring them home. While with Kevin, Naomi visits Dean and claims Castiel is still crazy and that he misinterpreted her orders and that she is on their side. Though Dean doesn't trust her, Naomi reveals that Sam traveled to Hell through Purgatory. Finding Ajay dead, Dean calls Benny to ask him to sacrifice his life and get Sam out of Purgatory the same way he got Dean out. Benny agrees and rescues Sam and Bobby from vampires in Purgatory, but stays behind to hold off some more as they escape, having never intended to leave as he doesn't fit in on Earth. Sam releases Bobby's soul into Heaven, but is stopped by Crowley who has figured out their plan. However, Naomi intervenes, drives Crowley away and allows Bobby's soul to go to Heaven. Despite more precautions, Crowley finds Kevin through his mother and captures him and all of his notes on the tablet. But when Sam and Dean arrive, they find no signs of struggle and the windows Crowley broke still intact, leaving Sam and Dean with no clues on the third trial and no Kevin who they believe is on the run.</p></div></div>

As Sam is still recovering from the second trial, Dean benches him and decides to teach Charlie how to hunt. After the coroner refuses to let them see the body, Dean decides to break in that night, but before he can, a second victim is discovered. At the crime scene, Sam shows up, refusing to stay behind and together they investigate only to learn that the coroner has cremated the bodies and they determine the monster is a "bastard offshoot" of a Djinn. Charlie leaves to secretly donate money to a brain-dead woman, but is captured by the Djinn who is actually the coroner and put into a fear-induced dream. While searching for Charlie, Sam and Dean learn about the woman who is actually Charlie's mother. They locate Charlie and kill the coroner, but are unable to free her from the Djinn's poison, so Dean enters Charlie's dreams to break her out. Dean finds her trapped in a nightmare of a video game she stole and sold as a kid where she must endlessly defend her mother from super-soldier vampires. Dean realizes that Charlie's fear is of losing her mother and he gets her to realize that her mother is long gone and let go. Once she does, she returns to the waking world where Sam has killed a second Djinn, the coroner's son and the true culprit behind the deaths. Charlie leaves, but is invited to visit again to look through the Men of Letters' archives. Dean finally agrees to let Sam hunt again and start the search for Kevin. Charlie decides to let her mother go and has her taken off of life-support, but first reads The Hobbit to her one last time like her mother used to do to Charlie when she was a child.</p></div></div>

At the same time, the real Sam and Dean receive a message from Kevin saying he is likely dead and sending them all of his notes on the tablet. Though they are unable to figure anything about the third trial out from the notes, a symbol in them points to a Native American tribe in Colorado that they think Metatron might be connected to. At a casino, they find the tribe is apparently gifted with immortality in exchange for giving Metatron gifts of stories and locate Metatron himself (Curtis Armstrong). Metatron explains that after God left, the Archangels decided to take over the universe themselves and not wanting that, he left and cut himself off so completely that he is unaware of who the Winchesters are or that the Archangels are all either trapped or dead. Sam and Dean try to convince Metatron to help them with their task. Kevin figures out Crowley has captured him and confronts Crowley who tries to kill him as he is no more use to him, but Metatron rescues Kevin who takes the second half of the tablet with him. Kevin and Metatron both reveal the third trial: to cure a demon. At the same time, Castiel hides from the angels by visiting restaurants in the Biggerson's chain using their similar layout and his ability to teleport to evade capture. One of the angels, Ion, reports to Naomi that, "we try and orient ourselves, but it's as if we are in every Biggerson's at once, trapped in a quantum superposition." Castiel is eventually caught and Naomi reveals that she has wiped Castiel's memory many times and he has taken part in many atrocities he can't remember (e.g. Death of the firstborn from Plagues of Egypt). However, Ion betrays them to Crowley who forces Naomi to flee and Crowley retrieves the angel tablet from Castiel's torso. After Kevin figures out the truth, Crowley leaves Castiel to Ion who Castiel eventually kills and escapes. He ends up on the road in front of Sam and Dean, badly injured and asks for their help.</p></div></div>

Investigating, Sam and Dean learn that the priests were testing out a theory that a demon could be cured of being a demon and that one continued his efforts until he was brutally killed. Listening to a recording of his last attempt, Sam and Dean learn that the priest succeeded and turned a demon back into a human and learn the process from his notes and the recording. They put Abaddon back together to try it on her, but Crowley calls to reveal that he has begun killing people that they have saved and while they are distracted, Abaddon escapes. Sam and Dean race to protect Sarah Blake (from season one's "Provenance"), but despite all of their efforts to protect her, they fail as Crowley has set up a spell to do the job rather than send demons. As Sarah dies, Crowley calls the Winchesters and taunts them, telling them that unless they surrender the demon tablet and stop the trials, he will kill everyone they have ever saved and will be keeping his demons away from them as insurance. Despite this, Dean is determined to continue despite them having no demon to cure. At the same time, Castiel is approached by Metatron, who reveals Heaven is in chaos and wants to seal it up to prevent the war from spreading to Earth. He suggests Castiel do the three trials needed to seal Heaven and reveals that the first requires killing a nephilim, the offspring of a human and an angel. Although reluctant to kill the nephilim (Linda Tomassone) because she has done nothing wrong, Castiel does so to protect Metatron when she fights back against them.</p></div></div>

Castiel enlists Dean's help in completing the angel trial. They discuss Castiel's return to heaven, and they succeed in persuading a cherub to give them her bow. Meanwhile, Crowley uses a blood spell to call upon other demons for help, only for Abaddon to answer his summons by trying to kill them both so that she can overthrow Crowley and rule Hell herself. Sam forces her to retreat by engulfing her in holy fire, and a tearful Crowley begins showing signs of becoming cured. Naomi appears to Dean and Castiel to tell them that she has learned that Metatron seeks revenge for how he was forced to leave to escape her breaking into his mind after God left and that he is actually tricking Castiel into helping him perform a spell that will expel all angels from Heaven. She also tells Dean that completing the demon trials will kill Sam. At Dean's insistence, Castiel brings him back to the church before returning to Heaven, where he discovers that Naomi has been killed by Metatron, who then takes him hostage. Finding that Sam is willing to die to atone for how often he has let him down, Dean talks Sam out of finishing the trials anyway, but the effects of the trials continue to ravage Sam's body and his life is left hanging by a thread. Meanwhile, Metatron completes his spell by extracting Castiel's grace (the essence of an angel that gives them their power and status as an angel), then sends the now-human Castiel back to Earth. Sam, Dean, Castiel, and Crowley look up into the night sky as thousands of angels begin to fall.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki) is dying from the events of the previous season. He dreams that he's talking with his brother Dean (Jensen Ackles), who is trying to convince him to fight to live, and their late friend Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver), who is trying to convince him to let go and die. Sam decides to follow "Bobby's" advice and crosses paths with Death himself (Julian Richings) again. Death explains that he has come to pay Sam the honor of reaping him personally, and Sam agrees to go with him so long as his death is permanent this time in attempt to prevent the suffering and death his and Dean's resurrections have caused in the past. Meanwhile, the angel Castiel (Misha Collins) has been turned into a human. He meets another angel, who is later revealed to have plans to possess him, as the body she is in now is deteriorating due to its inability to contain her. Castiel kills her to prevent her going through with her threat of disclosing his location to other angels, who seek revenge on him for locking them out of Heaven. Not knowing this, an increasingly desperate Dean prays to angels for help in saving Sam's life; this causes them to come attack Dean. However, one angel, Ezekiel (Tahmoh Penikett), has come to answer Dean's prayers. Due to the extensive damage wrought on Sam's body, he finds that he is unable to heal Sam with a touch as angels normally can. As he has been injured in the fall from Heaven, he suggests that he possesses Sam so he can heal him from the inside while at the same time healing himself. Dean agrees to this, and Ezekiel takes on Dean's form to talk to Sam in his head, using Dean's appearance and ambiguous wording to trick Sam into letting Ezekiel possess him. With Dean's agreement, Ezekiel erases Sam's memory of the event and stays hidden in Sam while secretly healing him.</p></div></div>

Sheppard) to the Men of Letters bunker to try to get the locations of all the demons on Earth from him. Meanwhile, his demonic rival Abaddon (Alaina Huffman) starts a movement to take over Hell. With the help of three demons that take soldiers as hosts, Abaddon captures two hunters and uses them to lure Sam and Dean into a trap outside Eugene, Oregon. Ezekiel briefly takes control of Sam and kills the three demons, causing Abaddon to flee. Sam continues to be unaware of his possession, as Ezekiel made it look like Dean killed the demons. The Winchesters' prophet ally Kevin Tran (Osric Chau) searches for a way to reverse Metatron's spell and kill Abaddon. He confronts Crowley, who claims that Kevin's mother Linda isn't dead. Kevin tries to leave the bunker to find Linda himself, but Dean convinces him not to go by telling him that he's family and that even if his mother is alive, she is as good as dead.</p></div></div>

Bartholomew is also actively hunting for Castiel, who is out on his own and struggling to find any stable shelter and food. Increasingly desperate, Castiel meets April Kelly (Shannon Lucio), who offers him food, takes him into her home, and tends to him, leading to them having sex. The morning after, however, April reveals herself to be a rogue reaper hired by Bartholomew to find him. After torturing Castiel for information on Metatron, she kills him when Sam and Dean arrive to rescue him. Dean kills her in retribution and has Ezekiel resurrect Castiel, lying to the others by saying that he had tricked April into resurrecting Castiel before he killed her. Castiel is relieved to finally have a place to stay at the bunker with his friends, but Ezekiel, fearing that Castiel will draw angry angels to them, forces Dean to kick Castiel out.</p></div></div>

Unable to find a way to kill her, Dorothy traps herself and the Witch inside a jar. In the present, Sam and Dean discover that the bunker's map table is connected to an ancient computer. They call in their tech-savvy friend Charlie Bradbury (Felicia Day) in the hopes that she can rewire the computer to track the fallen angels, but while they're in the room containing the computer, Dean accidentally releases Dorothy and the Witch. The four hunters work together to stop the Witch's plan to use a key to Oz somewhere in the bunker to bring her minions in Oz to the human world. Dean recognizes the key from his sorting through the bunker's artifacts, but the Witch takes advantage of his knowledge to steal it for herself and begin opening the door to Oz. The witch kills Charlie but Dean forces Ezekiel to bring her back , still hiding everything from Sam. She puts Sam and Dean under her control to find the girls and kill them. Charlie figures out that the Oz books held clues from Man of Letters L. Frank Baum to Dorothy—his daughter—on how to defeat the Witch. After Charlie stabs the Witch to death using the pointed heel of the ruby slippers—thus freeing Sam and Dean from the Witch's control—Dorothy uses the key to return to Oz and free it from the evil forces. Charlie takes her up on her invitation to go with her, as she has been longing for fantastical adventures of that kind ever since she became a hunter.</p></div></div>

Sam and Dean investigate and find the taxidermist's dog, The Colonel, who witnessed both murders. Dean casts a spell that allows him to communicate with animals but causes him to take on dog-like traits. They question The Colonel (voiced by Al Rodrigo) and various other animals, discovering that the killer is a man named Chef Leo (Steve Valentine) who is using shamanism to take on the traits of various animals by eating them. Chef Leo attacks and mortally wounds Sam, but Sam quickly recovers due to Ezekiel healing him. Chef Leo witnesses this and captures Sam. Chef Leo has been trying to find a way to cure his cancer by gaining the abilities of different animals, and now he hopes to acquire Sam's healing power by eating him. Dean calls a pack of dogs to maul Chef Leo to death. Dean takes The Colonel to a new home with loving owners and the spell wears off, returning Dean to normal.</p></div></div>

He calls Dean, who leaves Sam and Kevin at the bunker doing research, to investigate with Castiel. They visit the crime scene of the newest victim, and Castiel recognizes it as the work of a Rit Zien, a class of angel healers who are able to mercy-kill mortally wounded angels. Unable to differentiate between the temporary and permanent pains of humans, the Rit Zien has been killing those suffering from any distress. Castiel leaves the investigation to go to his boss's house, thinking she'd asked him for a date, but finds that she'd actually wanted him to babysit her infant daughter. There, Castiel is attacked by the Rit Zien angel Ephraim (Ashton Holmes), who heard his inner pain and is there to kill him. With Dean's assistance, Castiel kills the Rit Zien instead. Dean then leaves Castiel to his normal life. At the bunker, Kevin is only able to translate the angel tablet into an obscure form of cuneiform. Sam and Kevin make a deal with Crowley: in exchange for allowing him to contact Abaddon with a blood spell, he will translate the tablet for them. After communicating with Abaddon and having her tell him that she has seized control of Hell and is stamping out all his work and followers to remove his influence, a subdued Crowley translates the tablet for Sam and Kevin and tells them that Metatron's spell is irreversible. Later, Sam catches Crowley injecting himself with Kevin's blood for an unknown reason.</p></div></div>

Sam learns that Dean (Dylan Everett in flashbacks) spent two months at the school in 1995 after he got caught stealing food. Instead of it being a hard time for Dean, he enjoyed it and flourished, along the way having his first romance with a girl named Robin (Sarah Desjardins). On the night of a school dance, Dean's father returned to collect him and, despite Sonny's offer to let him stay permanently, Dean elects to leave to reunite with Sam (Hunter Dillon in flashbacks). In the present, Dean meets up with Robin (Erin Karpluk) again, though she initially pretends not to recognize him out of hurt that he had abandoned her without a word back then. They eventually patch things up. Sam and Dean go to the reform school, where they talk with a boy named Timmy (Sean Michael Kyer), whose mother is a ghost who has been protecting him from perceived threats at the cost of going murderously insane from being tied to Earth. She tries to kill Sam, Dean, and Robin, but is stopped by Timmy with Dean's encouragement. Timmy tells his mother to move on and she listens to her son, returning to her normal self as she departs.</p></div></div>

Sam and Dean realize that the victims all belong to the same church chastity group and so go undercover as new members to continue investigating. Dean discovers that the group councilor, Suzy Lee (Susie Abromeit), is one of his favorite porn stars; unhappy with her old life, she has quit the porn industry and is trying to turn over a new leaf. Wooing her with his genuine admiration for her and her work, he seduces her at the same time that Sam and Sheriff Mills realize that the people taken are members of the chastity group who have broken their vows of chastity. Before Sam and Sheriff Mills can get to them, Dean and Suzy are kidnapped and imprisoned in an old fallout shelter where the rest of the victims are being kept (save one who has already been taken away). Dean manages to call Sam and though the call cuts out quickly, the sound of a train whistle in the background clues Sam and Sheriff Mills in to Dean's location. They also deduce that they are dealing with the goddess Vesta (Lindy Booth), who has been posing as a member of the chastity group to select her victims. Sheriff Mills manages to kill Vesta and she, Sam, and Dean (who breaks free of confinement) rescue the surviving victims. However, Sam remains troubled by Vesta's words about him barely being kept alive. Seeing his brother's distress, Dean is about to tell him the truth, but Ezekiel reemerges and warns him not to.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>A civil war starts between angels working for Bartholomew and angels working for Malachi, an anarchist, both of whom want to rule the fallen angels, which will end in disaster. Sam and Dean initially investigate with Castiel, but Ezekiel makes Dean send Castiel away. Desperate, Castiel prays for help and is met by an angel named Muriel who is neutral in the war. Castiel convinces her to hear him out and she explains what she knows, but he is captured by Malachi and another angel named Theo who were tracking Muriel. Malachi tortures Castiel for information on Metatron, killing Muriel to try to force him to tell him what he knows. He reveals that many angels died in the Fall from Heaven, including Ezekiel. Malachi leaves Castiel alone with Theo who wants to defect to Metatron's side. Castiel tricks Theo into releasing him, then steals his grace, turning him back into an angel and at least partially restoring his powers. After escaping, Castiel calls Dean to warn him about "Ezekiel." At the same time, Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) meets with "Ezekiel," who is revealed to actually be Gadreel, the appointed guardian of the Garden of Eden until he let Lucifer in and fell into disgrace in the eyes of the Heavenly Host. He was imprisoned in Heaven's dungeon for not stopping Lucifer and was only released by the Fall. Metatron, having grown bored with his solitary rule of Heaven, proposes working together to restore Heaven with angels that they like. Gadreel is initially reluctant, but agrees and is given orders by Metatron to kill Kevin to prove his allegiance. After learning the truth from Castiel, Dean uses a sigil to knock Gadreel out so that he can tell Sam the truth, but "Sam" knocks him out and reveals himself to really be Gadreel, having altered the sigil so it gave him control rather than Sam. Gadreel kills Kevin and leaves, taking with him the angel and demon tablets, but leaves Dean alive to mourn the loss of Kevin and Sam.</p></div></div>

Though Gadreel hesitates to kill his friend, he goes through with it in the end. Back at the bunker, Castiel informs Dean that Crowley can bypass the angel and help them talk directly with Sam, who can then cast Gadreel out. After they find and capture Gadreel, he proves immune to Crowley's methods of torture so Dean reluctantly agrees to allow Crowley to possess Sam to communicate with him directly. With Crowley's encouragement, Sam manages to expel Gadreel who repossesses his old vessel to continue his work for Metatron. Abaddon, having tracked them down, arrives and Crowley stays behind to hold her off while Sam, Dean and Castiel escape. Crowley tells Abaddon that rather than the bloody battle between the two of them she has been anticipating, they are in the middle of a "campaign" to win the hearts of their demonic subjects for rulership of Hell. He then leaves before Abaddon can attack him. Meanwhile, it is discovered that Gadreel has restored enough of Sam's health that Castiel can take over healing him through conventional means. Dean tells Sam that he is going to hunt Gadreel alone as he believes that he causes too much hurt to those around him. Hurt by Dean's trickery, Sam tells him that Gadreel is not their problem, but refuses to elaborate, instead bidding Dean to go.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Crowley approaches Dean for help with finding the First Blade, the only known weapon that can kill Abaddon. Following clues, Dean and Crowley discover that Dean's father had once worked with a hunter named Tara who spent years searching for the Blade. Finding Tara, they cast a locator spell she found that leads them to the "retired" demon Cain (Timothy Omundson), who had trained—and then killed—all the other Knights of Hell except Abaddon, who had escaped his wrath. Cain refuses to help them, even letting in a group of other demons to fight Dean and Crowley, who kill them. Cain reveals that he wants revenge on Abaddon, as she murdered his wife, but is unable to exact it himself because he is bound by his promise to his wife not to kill anymore. Cain also reveals that the spell led them to him because his Mark (the brand Lucifer marked him with when he turned him into a demon) is the source of the Blade's power and he can transfer it to someone worthy. Despite Cain's warnings of an unknown but terrible cost, Dean agrees to bear the Mark so that he can kill Abaddon. Cain asks for Dean to kill him after killing Abaddon and sends him and Crowley to safety as he single-handedly defeats a swarm of demons that arrived to kill them. Having picked up on Crowley giving himself away in small but tell-tale ways, Dean confronts Crowley on having been deceiving and manipulating him all along, including having allowed Tara to be questioned, tortured, and killed by demons so that they would find him and Dean and Dean could prove himself worthy to Cain for the Mark. However, Dean can't retaliate against Crowley yet because he still needs Crowley to retrieve the First Blade from the bottom of the ocean. Running parallel to this plot is Sam and Castiel's attempts to harvest the part of Gadreel's grace that is still inside Sam so that they can use it to track the angel. Removing the grace causes Sam to start reverting into the state he was before Gadreel possessed him, but Sam refuses to let him stop until they get all the grace they need, even if it means his death. Due to his own brief humanity, Castiel empathizes with Sam's desire to make up for the people who've died from the choices he, Sam, and Dean have made, but refuses to risk killing Sam, instead stopping and finishing healing Sam and eliminating the last of the grace. The spell turns out to be unsuccessful because they didn't get enough grace. Castiel leaves to track Metatron, who he believes holds the key to fixing everything.</p></div></div>

Garth insists that he and his pack don't harm humans and peacefully coexist. While Sam is more willing to trust Garth, Dean isn't after his long disappearance and due to his suspicious nature. As everything seems to be fine, Sam and Dean are lured into a trap by the local sheriff who is also a werewolf and are forced to kill him when he attacks. Looking for Garth, Sam finds him and his wife Bess missing and is kidnapped by a few members of the pack while Dean finds out that they worship Fenris and believe that when Ragnarok comes, they will rule over mankind.

While tasting the spa's pudding, Dean gets drugged by roofies and they realize the spa's owner is a monster after Dean catches her eating refrigerated fat.

Maritza set up the spa to harmlessly feed on human fat from her customers without harming anyone, but her brother wasn't content with that and wanted to feed on people until death. Tracking down Alonzo, Sam and Dean kill him and pass it off as a psycho serial killer to the police.

Later, Dean tries to clear the air between him and Sam about what he did to save him, but Sam points out that Dean did it for himself so he wouldn't be alone. When Dean tries to contend that Sam would do the same for him, Sam tells him he wouldn't, leaving Dean stunned.</p></div></div>

Kevin has learned that his mother's alive and asks them to rescue her. Sam and Dean locate Linda (Lauren Tom) in a storage facility in Wichita, Kansas, but are captured by a demon there in the guise of a storage facility employee who is working for Crowley and keeping Linda prisoner. The three manage to break free and Linda gets the satisfaction of killing the demon herself. She is reunited with Kevin's ghost and, despite the risks, decides to take him home with her. Before they leave, Kevin asks Sam and Dean to set aside their issues. Despite promising him they will, they go back to ignoring each other when he's gone. Meanwhile, Castiel is captured by Bartholomew, revealed to be a former subordinate of his who wants Castiel to ally with him to unite all of the angels. However, Castiel doesn't agree with Bartholomew's savage ways and wants to bring an end to the in-fighting he's causing. In a fight, Castiel is forced to kill him in self-defense.

Sam and Dean find their old ghost hunting rivals Ed and Harry of the Ghostfacers are also there investigating, collecting more stories on Thinman. Sam and Dean are confused because the deaths don't seem related to the supernatural and the pictures seem faked, but then Thinman is caught on-camera murdering a diner manager. After Harry himself narrowly escapes Thinman, Ed confesses that he had invented Thinman to keep Harry from leaving to lead a normal life as their old teammates had, a revelation that infuriates the other man. Sam and Dean are taken captive by the local deputy, who reveals that he and his psychopathic partner-in-crime, a busboy who had killed his boss the diner manager and the girl for petty reasons, have been using Thinman as a cover to go on a killing spree, disguising themselves as Thinman and staging the murders as supernatural occurrences to make it seem that Thinman is real in order to feed the legend. They plan to have "Thinman" kill Sam and Dean next, but when Ed and Harry arrive, they get distracted, allowing Sam and Dean to break free and fight back; in the ensuing struggle, Dean kills the busboy and Harry is forced to kill the deputy to save Ed. Dean then covers up their involvement by staging the scene so it looks like the killers killed each other. At the end of the episode, Harry refuses to forgive Ed for his deception and leaves the Ghostfacers and Ed behind for good.</p></div></div>

Finally, they track the Blade to a rogue Man of Letters named Cuthbert Sinclair (Kavan Smith).

She reveals that Abaddon had been present at her convent and removing people's souls before encountering Henry Winchester (Gil McKinney) and Josie Sands (Alaina Huffman) of the Men of Letters. When Abaddon was about to possess Henry, Josie persuaded Abaddon to take her instead. Abaddon left with an oblivious Henry with the intention of studying the Men of Letters from within before destroying them. Now she has demons working for her stealing souls again in order to turn those souls into an army of demons.

Several angels want Castiel to lead them against him, but Castiel refuses. Castiel is approached by Gabriel, who says he survived and came out of hiding to be the leader against Metatron. Castiel realizes this is an illusion created by Metatron. Metatron views the whole angel war as a story and wants Castiel to play the villain by leading angels against him, and even though he will fail, Metatron claims he will let him back into Heaven and give Castiel a power supply for his new grace which will burn out and kill him if he cannot soon recharge it. Sam and Dean capture Gadreel, and while Dean is alone with him, Gadreel goads him about what Sam really thinks of him. Dean is heavily tempted by the Mark of Cain to kill him, but is just barely able to resist the urge. Metatron tells Sam he will trade Castiel for Gadreel. At the trade, Metatron easily puts out holy fire and erases angel warding. He says Sam and Dean cannot stop him, but it will be fun watching them try, as he departs with Gadreel. Castiel seems to somberly accept the mantle of leader of a group of angels as Metatron had wanted.</p></div></div>

Tracing the nest to O'Neill, Nebraska through a bus ticket, Sam and Dean confront one of the vampires while Jody protects Alex.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In this back-door pilot for a proposed new TV series (Supernatural: Bloodlines), five different mafia-esque monster families are running the underbelly of Chicago, Illinois. One is a family of shapeshifters run by Margo Lassiter (Danielle Savre), whose leadership is thrown into question when her younger brother David (Nathaniel Buzolic) returns home to claim his place in the family business. The other reigning family in town is made up of werewolves, led by Julian Duval (Sean Faris). The Families' paths cross with Sam and Dean when they meet Ennis (Lucien Laviscount), a man with a personal vendetta against the monsters when his girlfriend is murdered by a mysterious figure with silver claws who kills David's brother, Sal. The Winchesters warn Ennis about heading into the hunter lifestyle, but Ennis refuses to listen and starts down a dangerous path. David is revealed to be having a romance with Violet, the werewolf sister of Julian, which could bring on a full-scale war amongst the Five Families with the humans caught in the middle. After Violet is kidnapped, Sam, Dean, David and Ennis team up to save her, learning that the thing that killed David's brother and Ennis' girlfriend is actually a man driven insane with revenge by the death of his son at what he believes to be the Families' hands and wants to drive them to war against each other. Ennis kills the man as vengeance for his girlfriend's death and decides to take up hunting to protect Chicago from the monsters despite a mysterious phone call from his supposedly-dead father while Sam and Dean must leave due to a lead on Metatron. At the request of his father, David rejoins his family and prevents the war by revealing the truth of the murders to his sister who is not happy with his return.</p></div></div>

Sam and Dean are able to trick the prisoner into revealing that Metatron has a secret portal into Heaven for his followers and is amassing an elite ground force for an unknown reason. Before they can get more out of him, however, he is assassinated by a spy in Castiel's ranks. In response, Castiel meets with Gadreel (Tahmoh Penikett) to discuss him becoming a spy for his faction. Castiel is ambushed at the meeting, but Gadreel insists he had nothing to do with it. Castiel attempts to convince Gadreel that he is fighting for the wrong side and that he should become Castiel's spy. At the same time, Abaddon (Alaina Huffman) travels back in time to 1723 and kidnaps Crowley's son Gavin to use as leverage against him. Crowley agrees to help Abaddon kill the Winchesters and leads them to where he has hidden the First Blade, but secretly warns Dean of the trap. After sending Sam on a wild goose chase, Dean confronts Abaddon alone and succeeds in killing her, with the Mark of Cain protecting Dean from her powers. The Winchesters allow Crowley to live, but he teleports Gavin away so he won't be returned to his own time to die. In the aftermath, Dean refuses to be parted from the First Blade, claiming that it grants him a calmness and strength despite Sam's worries of what it's doing to him.</p></div></div>

This causes several angels to doubt Castiel's leadership despite Castiel saying he would not order such attacks. Metatron's side is outnumbered so he meets with Tyrus, the leader of an independent faction of angels. Tyrus refuses to join him, saying if Metatron killed him the rest of his angels would join Castiel. Just then, another suicide bomber attacks Metatron and the blast kills Tyrus. Dean finds another bomber, who turns out to be the reaper Tessa (Lindsey McKeon). The other angels view Dean as a savage killer and insist he only talk to her for answers. Tessa says she was tormented by pain from the human souls trapped on Earth since Heaven was closed and although she was too much of a coward to kill herself before, she will happily die for Castiel's cause; she then impales herself on the First Blade, making it look like Dean killed her. Metatron contacts Castiel's side, saying Tyrus's angels have joined him and Castiel does not care about the other angels, only winning the war before he dies when his new grace burns out. Metatron offers the rest of Castiel's angels amnesty if they join him now. The angels demand Castiel kill Dean to prove he is a worthy leader, but Castiel refuses, so all his angels abandon him for Metatron. Gadreel is disturbed to learn Metatron planned all this by brainwashing the suicide bombers into thinking they were dying for Castiel. Dean completely refuses to be separated from the First Blade even if it brings out an uncontrollable rage in him. Gadreel offers to tell Castiel and the Winchesters everything about Metatron to stop him, but Dean attacks Gadreel with the First Blade, forcing Sam and Castiel to restrain him.</p></div></div>

Gadreel reveals that Metatron intends to convert humanity into following him instead of God. As the power Metatron draws from the angel tablet makes him unstoppable, Gadreel and Castiel decide to infiltrate Heaven to break the tablet and his power, while Sam goes after Metatron himself. Dean summons Crowley, who helps him escape and start tracking down Metatron, but Dean has Crowley leave after Sam agrees to help him. The two track down Metatron, but Dean proves no match for him and is fatally wounded. In Heaven, Gadreel and Castiel are found out and locked in Heaven's dungeon, but Gadreel sacrifices himself to free Castiel and convince the angel Hannah to help him. Castiel finds and shatters the angel tablet, reverting Metatron to a regular angel and forcing him to flee before Sam can kill him. Metatron confronts Castiel, arrogantly telling him that he will rule both humanity and the angels who he sees as beneath him, not knowing that Castiel is broadcasting his words to every angel in existence. The angels turn on Metatron, overpowering him and Castiel locks Metatron in Heaven's dungeon rather than kill him. While the other angels look to Castiel as their leader once more, Castiel would rather be a regular angel and is faced with the fact he will die soon unless he replenishes his grace. Dean succumbs to his injuries and dies, and while Sam tries to summon Crowley to make a deal to resurrect him, Crowley visits Dean, revealing that the Mark of Cain won't let go of him. Crowley tells him about how the human Cain had been transformed into a demon by the Mark upon his death; Crowley then places the First Blade in Dean's hands, and Dean opens his eyes, now a demon himself.</p></div></div>

Sheppard)—partying at bars, singing bad karaoke, and sleeping with a waitress. Meanwhile, Sam (Jared Padalecki), oblivious to Dean's state, has been searching desperately for his missing brother. He eventually finds out the truth from Crowley after investigating the death of an Abaddon loyalist whom Crowley had purposefully sent to his death by attacking Dean. Crowley confesses that he has been sending Abaddon loyalists after Dean to sate Dean's bloodlust. Sam tracks Dean and Crowley to Beulah, North Dakota, but gets ambushed by an unknown man (Travis Aaron Wade) who is also looking for Dean. Dean gets a call from the man, who demands that Dean trade himself for Sam's life. However, Dean doesn't care about his brother anymore, refuses the deal, and hangs up, leaving Sam in the kidnapper's hands. Elsewhere, a dying Castiel (Misha Collins) is approached by Hannah (Erica Carroll), one of his followers in the previous season, for help tracking down Daniel and Adina (Jud Tylor), two rogue angels who refuse to return to the restored Heaven, instead wanting the freedom that life on Earth gives them. While Castiel is understanding towards the couple, Hannah is not, and a fight ensues that results in Castiel having to kill Daniel to save Hannah. Afterward, Hannah reveals that she doesn't like the idea of angels taking on human values, as she fears it would lead to chaos. Castiel, however, thinks it's a good idea.</p></div></div>

Meanwhile, Crowley and Dean have a falling out after Dean refuses to follow Crowley's orders and embarrasses him in front of his demon subjects. Realizing that the situation has gotten out of his control, Crowley contacts Sam with Dean's whereabouts to have Sam handle his brother. Sam offers to help Dean become human again, but Dean is uninterested, having found a kind of liberty in being a demon and in not caring anymore. Cole then ambushes the brothers and takes Dean on in a fight, but is easily defeated. Dean leaves him alive so that he will have to live with the shame of having been unable to avenge his father. Sam seizes the opportunity to capture the distracted Dean. In return for Crowley's help, Sam gives him the First Blade. Cole, having learned about Dean's demonic nature, starts researching the supernatural, still determined to take revenge on Dean. Elsewhere, Hannah goes to visit Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) in his prison, in the hopes of making a deal to save Castiel's life, but Castiel manages to stop her, insisting that she respect his choice not to save himself through evil means.</p></div></div>

Crowley gives a reluctant Castiel Adina's grace, restoring him to full strength. In return, Crowley asks Castiel to deal with Dean. Having captured Dean, Sam begins the process of curing him using the ritual they discovered a year and a half before. As the ritual goes on, Dean taunts Sam over his desperate attempts to find him, including tricking a man into selling his soul so he could interrogate a crossroads demon.

They are able to successfully complete the ritual and Dean is returned to being human, but retains the Mark of Cain. Castiel suggests that a guilty-feeling Dean take some time off as things are quiet, however, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a mysterious red-haired woman (Ruth Connell) sits in a hotel room under two men staked to the ceiling.</p></div></div>

Sam and Dean trace Kate's last call and discover that the real killer is Kate's sister Tasha, whom Kate had turned, in order to keep her from dying of fatal injuries from a car accident. Unlike Kate, Tasha has embraced her monstrous instincts and started killing. Dean tricks Kate into leading them to her sister, but Tasha reveals that she now has a "pack" consisting of two men she has turned, and has the boys captured. She offers Kate to join the pack as well if Kate kills Sam and Dean, but Kate refuses and, realizing that the sister she knew is lost to her, kills her before making her escape. Sam and Dean kill the two remaining werewolves. At the end of the episode, Dean accepts that he's not ready to get back into hunting yet, but feels he has to as he wants to do good after doing so much bad as a demon.</p></div></div>

They are shocked to discover that the school musical the teacher had been planning to shut down is based on the books that they'd discovered in the fourth season which had been written about their lives by former prophet Chuck Shurley. When a student also disappears after she, too, quit with plans to shut down the musical, Sam and Dean eventually realize that the goddess Calliope is behind this as she wants the musical to be completed, at which point she will eat the writer, Marie. When trying to catch Calliope before she can get Marie, Sam gets captured by her while Dean must battle a scarecrow creation of hers. With the help of the student and the teacher Calliope had kidnapped, Sam kills her, causing her and her scarecrow to explode, the latter being witnessed by the audience, who believe that it was special effects and applaud the musical. Marie gives Dean a prop version of his old amulet—a symbol of his brotherhood with Sam, Dean had thrown it away in the fifth season when he lost faith in Sam—which Dean ends up hanging on the Impala's mirror. After the brothers leave, Marie is greeted by Chuck (Rob Benedict) who congratulates her on the musical.</p></div></div>

Metatron agrees to tell them and tells them that they need the First Blade which Crowley has hidden. Sam and Dean meet with Crowley who reluctantly agrees to retrieve the Blade from a crypt in Guam, but later tells them that he will only give it to them once they have the rest of the spell. Dean demands Metatron give them the rest, but he states that he will want something for each bit of information and there is a lot. Metatron taunts Dean into attacking him, causing him to fall further and further under the Mark's influence. Dean comes close to killing Metatron, but is stopped by Sam and Castiel who takes Metatron back to Heaven rather than risk his life. However, Metatron leaves a possible clue for them to mull over: "the river ends at the source." Sam suggests that part of beating the Mark's power involves Dean actually fighting it like Cain did rather than embracing it. At the same time, Rowena plots against Crowley, using a spell to induce a nightmare and spy on Crowley's meeting with the Winchesters. Rowena sends a demon named Gothrey to get the First Blade then kills him, but when Crowley walks in on her, she twists the situation to her advantage, making him suspicious of the Winchesters and causing him not to give them the Blade. During this time, Castiel tries to help the daughter of his vessel, Claire Novak, but she refuses his help and meets up with a couple who suggest she kill Dean since he was responsible for the deaths of both her fathers. Claire lures Dean into a trap, but ultimately can't go through with it and warns him of the attack. Dean defeats the couple, but rather than give into the Mark's rage, lets them go. Castiel later finds Claire who has decided to find a new life away from him, but promises to keep in touch.</p></div></div>

Tracing a woman involved, they find a dark Charlie who flees after slashing the Impala's tire and beating up Dean. To their surprise, another Charlie shows up and explains that in order to win the war in Oz, she made a deal with the Wizard of Oz to split herself into her good and dark sides. Killing Dark Charlie will kill her and she can't return to Oz to ask the Wizard for help as Dark Charlie broke the Key to Oz.

However, Dark Charlie tricks Dean and kills him anyway. She then leaves with the Impala to find Sam and Charlie who discover a former Man of Letters named Clive Dylan who could help them.

In the aftermath, Charlie is unable to return to Oz and so dedicates herself to helping get rid of the Mark of Cain, forgiving Dean for his actions.

Hansel tells them how to reverse the spell and offers his help in stopping Katja. However, when Sam and Dean try to kill her as she prepares to eat Tina, Hansel reveals himself as evil and disarms them.

In order to stop Cain, Dean calls upon Crowley to give him the First Blade, lying to him that Cain wants Crowley dead. As a result, Crowley blows off his mother Rowena's wish to kill a witch of the Grand Coven to help the Winchesters. Working together, the four trap Cain in a devil's trap, a mythical symbol that binds his powers, when he arrives to kill his next victim, a twelve-year-old boy. Dean confronts Cain alone who tells him there is no cure for the Mark of Cain and its just better to give into its power. Dean and Cain fight, but Dean loses as he holds back in fear of losing his humanity. However, Dean eventually manages to get the upper hand and asks if Cain will give up killing again. Upon Cain's declaration that he won't, Dean kills him, devastated by the fact that there seems to be no way out for him. Despite his fears, Dean manages to keep control of himself, but gives Castiel the First Blade instead of Crowley as he promised, shocking Crowley with his lies. Rowena later tells Crowley that he's not a king anymore and is nothing but the Winchesters' lap dog. While Sam expresses the belief that if Dean could kill Cain himself without losing his humanity there is still hope for him, he privately tells Castiel that Dean's in trouble.</p></div></div>

However, the wife had no memory of the murder so they believe it to be a case of ghost possession as there is no sign of a demon and it doesn't fit the way they do things. The only connection they can find between the victims is they all went to confession so Dean visits confession in hopes of drawing the ghost out. In the process, he admits that while he's always felt he'd die hunting, he feels that time is approaching and he's not ready for it. Its revealed that the ghost is that of a nun named Isabella who in 1520 fell in love with an artist named Piero who didn't love her back so she was sent to a convent by her family to deal with her grief. Another nun, Sister Mathias who has been talking with Isabella, overhears Sam and Dean talking about what's been happening and reads Isabella's journal to learn that she killed Piero after finding him in bed with another woman. She alerts Sam and Dean and Dean orders Sam to burn the journal, believing Isabella to be tied to it as she was burned at the stake as a witch due to the horrific nature of her crime. While Dean tries to fight off Isabella possessing Sister Mathias, Sam reads the journal and learns that Isabella's blood and part of her finger were used to create the painting Piero made of her. Sam salts and burns the painting, destroying Isabella. Later, Sam tells Dean that he truly believes that there is a cure for the Mark of Cain and they need to keep searching, but Dean is unenthusiastic about it. At the same time, Crowley captures Olivette High Priestess of the Grand Coven for Rowena to make her case to in order to practice magic freely once more. Olivette reveals that the Grand Coven was devastated by the Men of Letters and is actually very weak now. She explains that the Men of Letters plundered the Coven's spells and potions and hid them in bunkers across the world and the only known surviving Men of Letters are Sam and Dean. This causes Rowena, who turns Olivette into a hamster, to use Crowley's relationship with Sam and Dean in hopes of getting at the plunder.</p></div></div>

Dean is able to beat the men and the Mark makes him immune to the spell, but he lets her go to save the men's lives. Rowena tries to trick Crowley into killing Dean for her, revealing that the Mark is just an ancient curse, but Dean and Crowley talk instead and Dean helps Crowley realize just how little Rowena means to him and he kicks her out. Sam and Dean later lie to each other about what they did and Sam reads a note from Bobby telling him to keep looking and stop lying to each other.</p></div></div>

However, she is tracked by Jacob Styne, who is determined to find the book as well, claiming that it belongs to his family. Sam and Dean meet with Charlie and try to translate the book which calls out to Dean to be used. Dean learns from the Men of Letters files that the man and his family are the Styne family, a family who used the book to commit evil acts until it was taken from them a century before. After an encounter with Jacob, Dean orders Sam to burn the book as its evil and dangerous. Sam appears to burn the book during a fight with Jacob and his family are killed, but warn that other Stynes will never stop until they retrieve the book. It's later revealed that Sam kept the book intact because it is the only chance of removing the Mark of Cain, no matter the consequences. At the same time, Castiel and Metatron search for Castiel's grace, coming under attack by an angry Cupid along the way. Searching for the grace inside a library, Metatron incapacitates Castiel with a spell and takes the demon tablet, what he had really come searching for. However, Castiel manages to recover his grace and is restored to full power though his wings are still broken. Sam and Castiel do not tell Dean that Metatron is on the loose with the tablet. After celebrating Castiel's full return with Dean and Charlie, Sam meets with Rowena, believing her to be the only one capable of translating the book.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Sam meets with Rowena in hopes of translating the Book of the Damned. Rowena agrees in exchange for Sam killing Crowley for her and reveals that she can't actually read the book, only a dead witch named Nadia could. However, Nadia left behind a decrypting codex, which the Men of Letters took when they killed her. Sam begins a search for the codex and discovers Magnus (Kavan Smith) had hidden it within the Werther Box, a vault that caused whoever tried to open it to kill themselves. Sam tracks the box to St. Louis, Missouri, where he is joined by Dean after attempting to leave him behind. After being barred by Suzie (a woman whose family died in the 70's after she tried to open the box herself), Sam sneaks into the house with Dean's help and tries to disarm the system with a spell. However, he is unsuccessful and unleashes a spell that traps Sam, Dean, and Suzie in hallucinations which try to get them to kill themselves. Suzie does, while Sam is saved by Rowena, whom he teams up with to disarm the box. Sam learns that the only way is for a Man of Letters to spill all of their blood onto the box, which he starts to do to save Dean. At the same time, Dean hallucinates that he is in Purgatory with his old friend Benny (Ty Olsson) who encourages him to kill himself to keep Sam and Castiel from having to do it later. Dean nearly does, but he knows the Mark won't allow him to kill himself and also, he sees through the illusion as the real Benny would never want him to do it, so he kills "Benny", freeing himself from the spell. It is revealed that Sam had been hallucinating Rowena's presence as Dean stops Sam from killing himself and sheds his own blood into the box, breaking the spell and opening it. Sam and Dean get the codex and Dean destroys the box to be sure it's no longer a threat. Sam takes the codex to the real Rowena, but chains her to make sure she only uses the book to get rid of the Mark of Cain.</p></div></div>

After Claire explains what she's trying to do, the Winchesters and Castiel decide to help her look. While Sam helps Claire hack her mother's credit card information, Dean and Castiel interrogate Ronnie Cartwright, the man who knocked her out who according to Amelia's diary, was the last person to see her. After Dean gets rough, Ronnie admits he sent Amelia to a faith healer named Peter Holloway who had healed his eyesight. However, he'd quit after seeing that Holloway was up to no good, cutting the people sent to him. After they leave, Ronnie calls Holloway who blinds him once again and kills him. Using this information, Sam is able to track Holloway to a farm house, but leaves Dean and Claire behind due to the Mark of Cain's effects on Dean getting worse. Castiel finds Amelia who is trapped in a dream life where she has reunited with Jimmy and wakes her, but she is extremely weak and he is unable to heal her. Sam is captured by Holloway at the same time that Dean and Claire realize he is one of the Grigori, a group of angels that prey upon humans. Holloway, revealing himself as Tamiel, tells Sam that he's been hiding on Earth from the other angels by feeding on human souls since the beginning, seeing both angels and humans as beneath him. Afterwards, Dean, Sam, Castiel and Claire come to Amelia's rescue, but are unable to defeat Tamiel. Amelia sacrifices herself to save Claire, who then kills Tamiel with his own sword in revenge. Amelia is reunited with her husband Jimmy in Heaven while the Winchesters decide to send Claire to Jody until she can get on her feet. Claire finally forgives Dean and Castiel for their roles in her father's death and Dean leaves her with a lore book as a gift as he realizes she is intending to become a hunter.</p></div></div>

Eldon and another family member ambush Dean, but he manages to kill the other family member and capture Eldon. Eldon explains to Dean that the Styne family has existed for thousands of years and harvest organs they transplant into themselves to make them superhuman. The Stynes cause and take advantage of various disasters in history to make a profit including Adolf Hitler's rise to power and the September 11 attacks. The family is worldwide and was formerly known by the name Frankenstein before Mary Shelley discovered their secrets and wrote a book about it. After Eldon reveals that the Book of the Damned can't be destroyed, Dean goes to confront Sam and Eldon escapes by ripping off his own arm. At the same time, Crowley searches for his missing mother with help from Olivette, and Sam, Rowena, Castiel, and Charlie work on decoding the Book. After having too much of Rowena, Charlie leaves to have peace and quiet and comes under attack by Eldon shortly after she finally breaks the code. Sam and Dean, who has finally learned the truth, tell her to give Eldon what he wants, but she destroys her computer instead of letting Eldon get her notes. Shortly afterwards, Sam and Dean find her dead, murdered by Eldon. Unknown to them, however, as her last act, Charlie emailed her notes on how to break the code to them so they could finish her work.</p></div></div>

Dean decides to slaughter the Styne family in revenge for her murder, and the guilt-ridden Sam at first gives into Dean's order for him to cease work on finding a cure for the Mark from the Book of the Damned. After noticing Charlie's email when telling Castiel of her death, however, he decides to continue and shows the email to Rowena. Rowena can now decipher the Book's secrets, but will only do so once Sam kills Crowley; thus, Sam lures Crowley into a trap and tries to kill him. Crowley survives but, embittered by Sam's betrayal and rejection of his attempts to be good, re-embraces his evil, now planning to kill Rowena for arranging for his death. Meanwhile, Dean tracks the Stynes to Shreveport, Louisiana, where he is arrested by the corrupt police before forcing the sheriff to tell him where to find the Stynes. Dean is captured when attacking their mansion and they prepare to dissect him, but he escapes and brutally slaughters the assembled family members. When he returns to the bunker, he finds the last three Stynes robbing it, and kills all three despite the youngest Styne's pleas for mercy. Castiel remonstrates with Dean, but Dean beats him savagely and comes close to killing him with an angel blade. Before leaving, he warns Castiel that he will kill him and Sam if he should see them again.</p></div></div>

Realizing he's gone too far, Dean summons Death (Julian Richings) to kill him before he hurts anyone else. Death explains that the Mark is the lock on the prison of an ancient evil called the Darkness and if the Mark is removed without being passed on, the Darkness will be released. He agrees to transport Dean far away in exchange for him killing Sam so Sam won't try to rescue him. Dean calls Sam and explains that he feels that they are evil and ridding the world of both of them is for the greater good. Sam eventually agrees, but reminds Dean of how good he is and his love for his family. At the last moment, instead of killing Sam, Dean turns Death's scythe on its owner, seemingly killing Death instead. At the same time, Rowena agrees to remove the Mark from Dean's arm in exchange for her freedom and Castiel calls on Crowley to get the necessary ingredients. One of these proves to be a young man who Rowena cares deeply about and she has to sacrifice for the spell. Unaware of the consequences, Rowena casts the spell and the Mark is removed, but she escapes, casting a spell on Castiel that causes him to attack Crowley. With the Mark gone, the Darkness is released into the world and washes over the Impala as the Winchesters desperately try to escape it.</p></div></div>

However, Amara begins levitating her toy blocks and Jenna's religious grandmother calls an exorcist while Jenna calls Dean. Dean arrives to find the "exorcist" to be Crowley who explains that he senses an ancient darkness in the child. At the same time, Jenna visits Amara and then suddenly murders her grandmother. Investigating the noise, Dean finds the Mark of Cain on Amara and remembering it on the woman from his vision, realizes that Amara is the Darkness. Confronting Jenna, Crowley realizes that she is now soulless, Amara having consumed her soul. Dean and Jenna fight before Crowley kills her. Crowley reveals he intends to use Amara for his own purposes, but Dean incapacitates him only to find Amara, now grown into a young girl, gone. Crowley later approaches Amara with people for her to feed on. At the same time, two angels torture Castiel before Hannah saves him. When he asks about the location of the Winchesters, Castiel realizes it was a ruse to get information from him. The other two angels try to hack his mind, but Rowena's spell gives him the strength to break free and fight back. Castiel kills the other two angels, but not before they kill Hannah. An infected Sam works to find a cure to the Darkness' poisoning with little luck. He encounters a Reaper who informs him that him and Dean will be thrown into a void when they die and that he is "unclean in a biblical sense." As a result, Sam researches purifications from the Bible and finds a reference to holy oil. Using holy fire, Sam is able to cure himself and then save the remaining people in the town. Returning to the bunker, he and Dean find Castiel begging for help.</p></div></div>

A call from Castiel explains it is a Nachzehrer, a ghoul and vampire-like creature. The wife wakes up and has been turned, kidnapping Dean in the car. She explains she killed her husband for not joining them and the new deputy is the alpha. The alpha is restored and explains he is scared of The Darkness so he is building an army. He will turn Sam, who is walking into a trap, and then they will eat Dean. Dean gets free and shoves copper pennies down the alpha's throat and decapitates him with the Impala's door, killing him and returning his victims to normal humans. Both bruised Winchesters agree to stop The Darkness after they heal, driving off in the battered Impala.</p></div></div>

However, a young woman in a jester mascot outfit brutally attacks the local football coach before being stopped by the school quarterback. After the quarterback tells them that the room suddenly got cold, the Winchesters realize they are dealing with a ghost who is possessing the various costumes and those who wear them.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>A little girl's imaginary friend, Sparkle the unicorn-man, is killed. Sam is shocked to wake up and see his own childhood imaginary friend Sully (Nate Torrence) is real. Sully explains he and Sparkle are Zână who appear to lonely children to cheer them up. Sully had done so for Sam when he wasn't allowed to go on hunts with John and Dean. Sully thought Sam wanted to be something other than a hunter and encouraged him to run away. However, John changed his mind and allowed Sam to join them so Sam rejects Sully as fake and Sully leaves hurt. Sully allows Sam and Dean to see his kind to help catch the killer, but a mermaid imaginary friend is also killed. A third one is stabbed but survives and contacts Sully for help. While Dean tracks the killer, Sam apologizes to Sully and explains his fear of returning to Lucifer's Cage. Sully forgives him and says even heroes can be scared, but they are the only ones brave enough to do what needs to be done. The killer captures Dean, and is revealed to be a young woman named Reese. Reese and her twin sister Audrey were Sully's next children after Sam, but Audrey was killed by a car while playing tag in the street with Sully. Reese read the folklore and paid a witch for the ability to see Zână and a blade that can kill Sully's kind as revenge. Sully offers to die if that is what Reese needs, though the brothers talk her out of killing him. Sully agrees to check in on Reese and wishes Sam luck. Sam admits to Dean he thinks he has to go to the Cage. Dean says there must be another way, but has no idea what that could be.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>A fully grown Amara kills religious preachers in a park and a church as attempts to get God's attention, dismissing religion as manipulation. Finally convincing Dean following the visions are their only choice, Sam and Dean approach Crowley for a way to communicate with Lucifer in The Cage. Crowley has Rowena captured to read from the Book of the Damned for this purpose and they form a tense alliance. Alone, Dean investigates the church deaths and senses Amara. She transports him away to talk, claiming she only wants to hurt God who supposedly exiled her because she might be better at making creations. She claims that she would rule the world to give everyone bliss like Dean feels with her. After Dean's attempt to stab her fails, Amara kisses Dean saying they are meant to be together ever since he freed her. A low level angel rallies all the angels in Heaven against Amara. He and two others go to arrest her, saying if she resists the combined might of every angel will kill her. Amara kills the three angels and sends Dean back to safety as the sky opens up and strikes her. The others proceed with the plan and Rowena wards The Cage while Sam speaks with Lucifer. Lucifer says The Darkness is equal to God in raw power and offers help if Sam agrees to be his vessel again. Sam refuses as the warding fails to Crowley's shock, though Rowena remains calm. Sam is pulled into The Cage where Lucifer reveals the release of The Darkness weakened The Cage and he's been the one sending Sam's visions and that God was never helping them.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Lucifer recently approached Rowena in a dream, promising her rewards if she helps him get to Sam. Dean searches for Sam and is sent by Crowley to Billie the Reaper who Sam had encountered recently. Billie lets Dean into Hell with a "witch collar" that allows Crowley to control Rowena. Castiel and a low level angel search to see if Amara survived while the angel points out Castiel is more expendable than the Winchesters. Amara survived and kills the other angel, then sends Castiel to Billie with a threat carved into his chest, though the effort of that does appear to weaken her. Meanwhile Lucifer says Sam has gone soft. Last time he fought him, he sacrificed himself to save the world. In recent years Sam and Dean only want to save each other regardless of the cost. Lucifer says making a sacrifice and being his vessel is the only way to stop The Darkness, since God is gone, Gabriel and Raphael are dead, and Michael has supposedly gone insane while imprisoned. Sam refuses, not believing its guaranteed Lucifer would win against Amara and even if it was, he'd then destroy the world himself. Lucifer pulls Dean and Castiel into The Cage and beats all three of them, though Rowena's spell seems to work to send him away. The brothers agree to find another way to stop Amara while Castiel hangs back. Castiel, having said yes at the last second to be Lucifer's vessel, goes to confront Crowley and Rowena. Lucifer makes sure Rowena is the only one who could open The Cage again and kills her, then saying he wants to talk to Crowley.</p></div></div>

His wife banishes the creature but also dies, leaving only their baby alive. In the present day Sam and Dean investigate a case in a retirement home where one of the residents died in a similar manner. A resident named Mildred sees the creature commit its second kill of the building manager. The brothers realize the creature is a Banshee, driving its victims insane with its voice before feeding on their brains. Sam is briefly captured by a deaf woman posing as a housekeeper named “Marleen”. “Marleen” was the baby who was raised by a hunter after her parents died, her real name is Aileen and her grandfather was a Men of Letters. The banshee's screams also destroyed her hearing. Posing as Castiel, Lucifer searches the bunker for a way to kill Amara and Dean admits his connection to her but asks to keep it a secret from Sam. "Castiel" agrees saying maybe they can use this to draw Amara out. Assuming Mildred is the next target, the Winchesters and Aileen protect her but are caught off guard when the banshee targets Dean. Mildred and Aileen are able to kill it. Aileen continues hunting while Mildred assumes Dean is attracted to someone out there. Later, Sam admits how Lucifer taunted him and apologizes for not looking for Dean while he was in Purgatory. Dean had forgiven him a long time ago. Sam is able to rest soundly, but Dean is still tormented by his thoughts.</p></div></div>

Sonya explains she uses the curse to punish cheating men and the stupid women who still love them. Melissa distracts Sonya, allowing Sam to kill her and stab the Qareen's heart, destroying it. Dean admits to Sam that he desires Amara when he is around her and doesn't think he can kill her even though he wants to. Sam promises he will kill Amara for both of them.</p></div></div>

Sam is able to use information from The Men of Letters to find another seal that will kill it, but someone must also place it in the nest. Both Dean and Bobby are taken into the nest and are soon possessed by the soul eater, attacking their partner in the real world.

Meanwhile, the Winchesters investigate a murder-suicide and soon learn it is a stronger version of the infection fog that is making the townspeople go mad. Chuck reveals he's been traveling the world and only wants to talk about things he's done as a human. Metatron's criticism of Chuck's writing gets him to reveal he has some sympathy for Lucifer turning into a villain because of the Mark of Cain and the burden of containing Amara. He likes the Winchesters and constantly brought back Castiel for them, but their quest to destroy the Mark is what freed Amara, so he is done helping them. Since God is Being while Amara is Nothingness, Chuck became lonely and thought by creating things he could convince Amara to be better, but she just destroyed everything. After barely locking her away and seeing all the conflict both humans and angels create, Chuck walked away, letting them sort it out for themselves and sees no point in fighting Amara again. Metatron is disgusted that Chuck has become a coward. While humans may have flaws, they also create beauty, art and love; they are God's greatest creations because they never give up. Chuck is briefly enraged but goes back to writing. As Sam is infected with the fog, Dean is unaffected holds onto him and yells for Amara to stop this. Chuck sings one song at the bar as a shocked Metatron reads the final pages of the autobiography. The fog and infections disappear and all the townspeople, including those who were killed, are restored to life. Dean finds his old amulet in Sam's pocket, glowing and they follow it to the middle of the street where it leads the Winchesters to Chuck. Chuck greets the shocked brothers and tells them they should talk.</p></div></div>

Chuck explains that he had once been much more hands-on with the world, but didn't seem to be making a difference so he left the world to find its own way but has returned to face Amara. At the same time, Amara continues to torture Lucifer and contacts Dean to send a message to God about Lucifer's state. While this is going on, another of Amara's fogs wipes out a whole town but results in a man named Donatello being called as a Prophet. As the Winchesters go to meet with Donatello, Metatron contacts them and reveals that Chuck intends to sacrifice himself to Amara to stop her destruction of the universe. After Dean fails to convince Chuck to stop his plan, the Winchesters team up with Metatron and Donatello to rescue Lucifer. To distract Amara, Dean meets with her and Amara suggests that he give up his humanity and become a part of her instead. Eventually Amara realizes that Dean has betrayed her and departs to stop Lucifer's rescue. Donatello is able to lead Sam and Metatron to Lucifer who agrees to put aside his differences with God to battle Amara. Metatron frees Lucifer and stays behind to hold off Amara when Lucifer can't teleport them out. After Metatron's attack fails, Amara implodes him into nothingness. Amara nearly kills Sam, Lucifer and Donatello, but Chuck teleports them back to the Bunker. There, Lucifer and Chuck greet each other for the first time in millennia before Chuck heals Lucifer's injuries. The Winchesters send Donatello on his way and Dean informs Sam of Amara's plans for him.</p></div></div>

When that was proven wrong, Chuck was angry at himself, confessing that was part of the reason he banished Lucifer along with protecting humanity. With Michael in no condition to fight and not enough time to revive Raphael and Gabriel- Lucifer/Castiel, Dean and Sam recruit the angels in Heaven, Crowley's forces, and Rowena and a few witches respectively. Despite their bickering they all agree to weaken Amara and allow Chuck to trap her in the Mark. Since both Chuck and Amara are essential to reality, Chuck won't kill her and wants to seal her within the Mark to be carried by Sam this time. Though Dean protests, he eventually agrees. Amara eats Donatello's soul and breaks into the bunker but willingly follows Rowena's trap to find her brother. Though Amara kills the other witches and walks away from both the angels' combined smite and an assault from Crowley and his demons, the combined attacks of everyone weaken her enough that she is prepared to be banished by Chuck. Though she laments how she did love her brother and gets him to admit part of the reason he created things was to rule over them, and he hated how they were equals. When Chuck tries to seal her into Sam she resists; stopping the Winchesters, apparently killing Lucifer and gravely wounding Chuck. Amara warns Chuck is not dead yet because he is going to watch her destroy everything ever created.</p></div></div>

As a result of Chuck's injuries, the sun is now dying and the world along with it. Realizing that the only chance for the world to survive is to kill the Darkness along with Chuck, the Winchesters begin gathering ghosts to create a bomb to destroy the Darkness. With the help of Billie the Reaper, they are able to get the needed souls which are inserted into Dean. Chuck sends Dean to Amara who has started to regret her actions and Dean convinces Amara that revenge is not worth it. Amara and Chuck reconcile and Amara heals Chuck of the damage she did to him. The two then leave the Earth, but not before Amara tells Dean she is going to give him what he wants most for helping her and Chuck removes the souls from Dean's body. At the bunker, Castiel is banished by a woman who identifies herself as Lady Antonia Bevell of the London chapter of the Men of Letters. Antonia tells Sam the Men of Letters have sent her to bring Sam in for punishment for his actions and fires her gun, apparently at Sam as he tries to talk her down. Making his way through the woods, Dean finds his resurrected mother.</p></div></div>

Toni explains that the British Men of Letters have kept Britain safe from monsters and now want to expand their influence into the United States. To this end, Toni demands information on all of the hunters in the US from Sam and when he refuses to give her what she wants, has her assistant Ms. Watt torture him. When Sam doesn't break under physical torture, Toni drugs him in order to torture him mentally with images of his loved ones dying. Sam sees through it and tricks Toni, but is narrowly prevented from escaping. At the same time, his brother Dean finds their long-dead mother, Mary Winchester, who has been resurrected and convinces Mary of his identity before filling her in on what she missed in the 33 years following her murder. Returning to the Bunker, the two learn of Sam's disappearance and begin tracking him with the help of a returned Castiel. Eventually, Dean is able to call Toni, who refuses to give back Sam and sends Ms. Watt to kill them. Though Ms. Watt initially has the upper hand, Mary kills her with Castiel's angel blade and they are able to use her cellphone to track Sam to Aldrich, Missouri. Meanwhile, after being expelled from Castiel, Lucifer has begun searching for a new suitable vessel but is burning them out fast in his weakened state. Intending to kill Lucifer and reclaim his rule of Hell, Crowley attempts to track Lucifer down without success.</p></div></div>

Mick Davies of the British Men of Letters arrives, letting Castiel join them and saying Toni went too far and that the Men of Letters want to work with hunters like the Winchesters to keep America safe. Sam reunites with Mary, elated she is alive. She mournfully looks over John's journal. Toni refuses to admit she did anything wrong since the Winchesters are too dangerous and Mick reveals he has already sent for Arthur Ketch, whom Toni seems wary of, to assist them with the Winchesters. Meanwhile, Crowley interrupts his witch mother Rowena's date to find Lucifer, who takes over the body of washed-up rock-star Vince Vincente. Crowley's plan to break Lucifer's vessel and send him back to the Cage fails, so Crowley flees and Lucifer takes Rowena prisoner.</p></div></div>

Jael locks Dean out of the house and everyone else in, but Dean is able to get in with help from the reaper Billie in exchange for owing her one. Jael kills another hunter before possessing Jody and revealing that he did not kill Asa as believed; rather, Asa was accidentally killed by his best friend Bucky while hunting Jael, and Bucky framed Jael to protect himself. While Jael is distracted with Bucky, the hunters manage to exorcise him from Jody. They promise to spread the true story of Asa's death, disgracing Bucky. The next morning, the three dead hunters are burned while Billie arrives to try and collect on her deal with Dean by reaping Mary, who she claims will never feel like she belongs in the world after her resurrection.

Castiel and Ishim explain that in 1901, Lily had married an angel named Akobel and had a Nephilim daughter. As this was against Heaven's laws, they killed Akobel and his daughter May; now Lily wants revenge. The Winchesters track down Lily and are shocked to learn that her daughter was human, not Nephilim. Lily had studied angels all of her life and her powers come from Enochian magic. Lily's studies had allowed her to summon Ishim, who taught her all the secrets of angels but became obsessed with her. Lily had married Akobel for protection and Ishim murdered Akobel and her daughter in revenge. Believing Lily's story, Dean heads off to confront Ishim, followed soon after by Lily and Sam. Dean and Castiel confront Ishim, who eventually confirms Lily's story and battles them. After Ishim defeats the humans, Castiel kills him to save Lily, who is unsure whether or not she will give up on revenge since it's all she's had for over a hundred years. Castiel apologizes for his role in the death of Akobel and May and offers that if she leaves and finds that she can't forgive him, he will be waiting for her to take her chance. Lily ultimately departs after thanking Castiel. Later, the Winchesters and Castiel discuss the troubling implications of Lucifer's child and Castiel breaking the deal with Billie.</p></div></div>

When Dean shows worsening memory loss, Sam contacts Rowena for help and is advised to kill the witch that cast the spell affecting Dean. Retracing Dean's steps, the two find the witch dead, but the spell still affecting Dean. Rowena recognizes the spell as the work of the Loughlin family, a powerful family of druidic witches long thought wiped-out. Rowena tells Sam that they must get the family's spellbook, the Black Grimoire to break the curse before it kills Dean. Sam tracks down Catriona and Boyd, the last two Loughlins, but is captured for a ritual to resurrect Gideon, the witch Dean killed. Rowena confronts Catriona while Sam attempts to break free. Before Catriona can kill Rowena, an amnesiac Dean follows instructions left behind by Rowena that allows him to arm himself with witch-killing bullets and kill Catriona and Boyd. Rowena is then able to use the Black Grimoire to break the curse on Dean restoring his memory from before he was cursed, though Dean can't remember any of the time during. The Winchesters promise they owe Rowena one, but take the Black Grimoire rather than letting her have it. While Dean admits that having a blank slate was nice, he prefers the life he has. The episode closes with a montage of the time Dean forgot over him riding a mechanical bull.</p></div></div>

The demon proves invulnerable to all of their attacks, has yellow eyes like their old foe Azazel, and mortally wounds Castiel with a lance. After another demon kills Wally, they escape and Crowley appears and warns the Winchesters that the demon is Ramiel, one of the four Princes of Hell along with Azazel, Asmodeus, and Dagon, the latter of whom is interested in Lucifer's child. After the defeat of Lucifer in Season 5, Crowley had attempted to give Ramiel the crown of Hell, but Ramiel told him that the Princes had no interest in Hell any more and simply wanted to be left alone, prompting Crowley to become King instead. Before leaving, Crowley gives Ramiel the Lance of Michael and the object that Mary stole in the present. Crowley realizes that the Lance of Michael is what was used against Castiel and warns that he will die slowly with no cure. Ramiel arrives and demands what was stolen from him and attacks when they refuse. After a battle, Sam kills Ramiel with the Lance of Michael and Crowley realizes that breaking the Lance will stop its effects on Castiel just in time to save his life. Afterwards, Mary confronts Ketch about sending her after a Prince of Hell, but eventually hands over the object she stole: the Colt.

Crowley has bound Lucifer with chains based on the Cage, but Lucifer is amused and informs Crowley of the survival of his child. Meanwhile, Mary works with Arthur Ketch of the British Men of Letters who suggests she distance herself from her sons as she is at her best on her own. Sam and Dean begin investigating a series of murders committed by a vengeful spirit and realize the ghost came from the ship of Gavin MacLeod, Crowley's son who was time-displaced to the present by Abaddon. Gavin realizes that the ghost is that of his fiancée Fiona who smuggled herself aboard the ship and endured rape from the crew before the ship sank off the coast of New England. To save Fiona and her victims, Gavin decides to return to his own time to die when the ship sinks but in doing so stop Fiona from going through her terrible ordeal. After sending Gavin back with the help of Rowena, the Winchesters find no signs of Fiona's kills. They are then visited by Mary who admits the truth about working with the British Men of Letters and attempts to convince her sons to work with them. Rowena is confronted by Crowley for helping to send his son back to possibly die and she admits it was revenge for forcing her to murder Oskar to remove the Mark of Cain in "Brother's Keeper." At the same time, Kelly Kline is attacked by two angels but is saved by the Princess of Hell, Dagon. Dagon offers to protect Kelly and her unborn son, which Lucifer detects and is pleased with.</p></div></div>

The Winchesters learn that Claire Novak is also investigating, hunting on her own and lying to Jody Mills about it. While investigating the attack, Mick discovers that Hayden has been bitten and returns that night to kill her per British Men of Letters protocol. His actions draw the anger of the Winchesters when they realize what he's done. Shortly afterwards, Claire is bitten by the same werewolf and the Winchesters realize the only chance to save her is an experimental cure created by Mick's organization that requires the blood of the werewolf that bit Claire. As the Winchesters search for the culprit, Claire and Mick are attacked by the werewolf who is revealed to be a young local bartender, Justin. After kidnapping Claire, Justin explains that he was part of a peaceful pack before they were wiped out by the British Men of Letters. Due to a werewolf's pack mentality, Justin is now desperately seeking companionship, which is his motive in turning Claire and Hayden. The Winchesters and Mick track down Justin and attack, killing him and getting his blood. Using Justin's blood, Mick is able to cure Claire. The next morning, Claire leaves a voicemail for Jody, finally telling her the truth and accepting Jody as her family, but also still planning to hunt on her own for the time being. The Winchesters also choose to give Mick a second chance, with the hunt changing Mick's view of the world of monsters as black and white.</p></div></div>

After the witness disappears, the Winchesters suspect the local sheriff, Barrett Bishop whose family owned the town until he recently sold most everything.

While Castiel was away, Sam has come up with a plan to strip the child of his powers and leave him human. However, Castiel is revealed to still be working with the angels and steals the Colt to kill Dagon and Kelly.

The brothers and the real Donatello appear, and when Asmodeus hurts them, a flicker of Jack's power makes him flee. At the bunker, Dean admits to Jack that he will kill him if he turns bad.

Taking the case, Sam convinces Dean to let Jack join them; also having convinced Jack to help save Mary if he can master his powers. There are no signs of a ghost or revenant. A woman is then killed by her dead son. Both victims shared a grief therapist Mia, whom the guys question pretending to be three brothers that lost their mother. Sam and Dean get into an argument about Mary; and Sam discovers Mia is a shapeshifter. Mia says she only helps people by pretending to be their loved ones to give closure, and the killer must be her ex boyfriend and fellow shapeshifter, Buddy. While Sam goes to Buddy's address, Buddy actually sneaks into Mia's office and knocks out Dean and Jack. When Mia refuses to kill them, Buddy prepares to shoot Sam when he walks into the room. Jack is able to use his powers to deflect the bullet away from Sam and throw Buddy into the wall, allowing Sam to kill him. Mia in Kelly's form tells Jack that even monsters can do good. At the bunker Dean gives Jack some approval; and wants Sam to keep believing Mary is alive, admitting that he no longer seems to believe in anything anymore. Meanwhile, Castiel is in The Empty, a place predating even God and Amara, where all angels and demons sleep forever after they die. Castiel is the first in eternity to wake up. The entity there takes Castiel's form and taunts him to go back to sleep as the entity hates being awake itself. Castiel refuses, forcing the entity to send him back to Earth.</p></div></div>

Asmodeus is unable to sense Jack, and is told that the Winchesters no longer have him. In the alternate world, Michael takes most of Lucifer's grace, using his Kevin Tran to create a portal for Lucifer's earth. Instead, Lucifer escapes and the portal closes. Lucifer arrives back in the correct time, but is greatly weakened. Meanwhile the brothers notice witches being killed. Talking to a survivor, they discover the killer is searching for Rowena and looks like Arthur Ketch. Capturing him, he claims to be Arthur's twin brother, Alexander, who turned his back on the British Men of Letters. Sam finds records of Alexander but Dean is skeptical. Castiel meets with the angel Dumah and is told the angels' population is very low and they intend to force Jack to create more angels when they find him. The angels try to capture Castiel, but Lucifer is able to scare them off. He tries to convince Castiel about the urgent threat of the other Michael, saying they need Jack's power, and he decides not to tell the Winchesters. Asmodeus then appears, deciding he is the ruler of hell, capturing them both. Tracking Castiel, the brothers are attacked by demons but are helped by Alexander; who finally admits he is Arthur. He tells them Rowena gave him a spell to cheat death in exchange for allowing her to escape after being captured by the British Men of Letters some years back, but it needs a recharge so he must find her, insinuating she survived. Dean attacks but Arthur escapes. Asmodeus locks up Lucifer and Castiel and tricks the Winchesters into thinking everything is fine; having worked with Arthur all along.</p></div></div>

In exchange, Barthamus requests the Winchesters aid his minions Smash and Grab in stealing a trunk from a man named Luther Shrike. Luther has Barthamus' trunk in a vault that only Dean can open due to his previous time in Hell. The Winchesters reluctantly agree to the deal and perform a raid on Luther's property. During the raid, Luther realizes the truth and kills Grab, a demon, before being captured by the Winchesters. With the help of Smash, who is a girl named Alice who once made a deal with Barthamus and is now forced to work for him, the Winchesters are able to retrieve the trunk. To their shock, the Winchesters learn that Luther is a man who once made a deal with Barthamus to save his son only to be double-crossed. The trunk contains Barthamus' human bones, leverage with which Luther can force Barthamus to leave him alone. Barthamus kills Luther, but the Winchesters reject his deal due to Barthamus' actions. Alice kills Barthamus by burning his bones, but the spell is destroyed with him.
