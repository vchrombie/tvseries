After Louis discovers that Hardman intended to make him the fall guy for his embezzlement schemes five years ago, Hardman admits his indiscretion, then tries to convince Louis that he is "not that person" anymore. Meanwhile, Harvey defends a brash sportscaster (Jeff B. Davis) who accuses a star baseball player of using performance-enhancing drugs, with no apparent evidence to back up his claims. Donna returns to the firm. Rachel learns that she did well on the LSAT. Mike uses his end-of-year bonus to buy an apartment for his grandmother in Manhattan. While waiting at the apartment for his grandmother so he can surprise her, Rachel arrives and informs Mike that his grandmother died.</p></div></div>

Mike meets his childhood friend Tess (Elisabeth Hower) at his grandmother's funeral, where Tess and Rachel support him in making a speech. Mike wants to act on the mutual attraction with Rachel, but she asks him to wait. Rachel changes her mind and goes to Mike's apartment, only to discover him in bed with Tess.</p></div></div>

Harvey wants to celebrate Hardman's dismissal with Zoe Lawford, but finds out that Zoe's brother has just dropped off his daughter, Olivia, on short notice. Meanwhile, Louis meets with Sheila (Rachael Harris), who already knows that he made senior partner and appears to be turned on by that fact. Louis asks for Sheila's help in landing a top-notch new associate from Harvard named Maria (Aarti Mann), but it's all for naught when Jessica makes up a "hiring freeze". Louis thinks it's a punishment, but Jessica does it to prevent him from hiring someone who could inadvertently reveal Mike's Harvard secret.</p></div></div>

Harvey is charged with keeping Dr. Ava Hessington out of jail, but the case is complicated by his former mentor — the special prosecuting attorney and disgraced former DA of Manhattan, Cameron Dennis. When Harvey discovers that Cameron is making a deal with Ava's protege Nick, he reluctantly teams up with Jessica in a different plan of attack. The case is eventually settled out of court with Ava keeping her company and staying out of jail, though Harvey is not entirely pleased with the settlement.

While Harvey is tied up with Ava's personal case, he asks Louis to represent Ava's company, Hessington Oil, amidst a potential hostile takeover. Katrina Bennett wants to work the case with Louis, but refuses to be his personal associate so he rejects her. She then tries to work for Harvey, but is stopped and put in her place by Mike and Donna.

While Jessica, Louis and Katrina want Ava to resign as CEO/President of Hessington Oil, Darby, Harvey and Mike don't. Katrina and Mike work together to find a way to prevent the Gionopoulos Holdings takeover. Together, they discover that since Tony Gionopoulos has other holdings which are regulated by the FTC, a takeover of Hessington Oil would put them in violation of anti-trust laws. Using this information, Louis confronts Gionopoulos' employee who laughs at Louis, saying they as Wharton investment bankers are smarter than any lawyers. He notes that Gionopoulos is having dinner with his "old friend", the FTC commissioner. Having failed to stop Gionopoulos, Louis offers to be Jessica's "black swan" and do her dirty work for her by convincing the Hessington Oil board to fire Ava, given that so many figure her to be guilty of the murders, and retain Pearson Darby as their legal counsel. During a mock deposition, Mike and Harvey become convinced that Ava is innocent. She says that she paid $100 million more in bribe money to prevent innocent people from being harmed, and to help relocate those who would lose their homes and livestock. The conflicts between Jessica and both Harvey and Darby heat up when she prevents Louis from going to the board, thus sealing Ava's fate as the board fires her. Meanwhile, Donna and Stephen agree to have a date and "an arrangement" to "satisfy his needs" while he is in New York. He gets tickets to see Daniel Day-Lewis in Macbeth, then tells Donna he has arranged dinner with Daniel after the show, causing her to instead take Stephen somewhere more private. She attempts to tell Harvey about this the next day, but the timing isn't right. Mike and Rachel proclaim their love for each other, shortly after Mike and Katrina agree to a truce.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Stephen assures Harvey that, despite Ava losing her company, winning Ava's murder trial is enough to get Harvey a shot at unseating Jessica as managing partner. Harvey figures his best chance at winning is to get the murder charge dismissed, but Cameron Dennis and the judge want to proceed with a trial. Harvey and Stephen then confront Tony Gionopoulos (Rob Stewart) with a threat to tie up his businesses in England with court cases unless he testifies that Dennis colluded with him to get Ava unseated, but Gionopoulos isn't scared away. Stephen then goes behind Harvey's back and threatens Gionopoulos' daughter with a lawsuit, thus causing an angry Gionopoulos to start dumping shares of Hessington Oil and depleting the company's value. Harvey approaches Jessica for help, and they plan to have Gionopoulos Holdings buy Hessington Oil but reinstate Ava as CEO, in exchange for Gionopoulos testifying that Dennis left him alone in a room with a damning tape of Ava for him to view. Despite the new evidence, Dennis refuses to call off the murder trial even though he figures his chances of winning are down to about 20%. Elsewhere, Donna and Stephen escalate their romance, but she gets angry with him when he references their relationship in an argument with Harvey. Louis confronts Nigel over his handling of the associates, while Mike and Rachel work on a case to get $30 million returned by an accountant who embezzled it from a client. Mike later gets angry with Rachel when he finds out from her father that she has applied to attend law school at Stanford. The episode concludes with Jessica telling Harvey her plans to add him as a named partner in the New York office, but he questions her motives.</p></div></div>

Taking Donna with him, he goes to work for Jessica, who with Hardman has just taken control of the firm in an overnight coup. Harvey and Donna have a tryst during the brief period she is not working for him, and they agree to conceal this thereafter. At the same time, college senior Mike receives an acceptance letter to Harvard Law school, but later sells answers to a math exam in order to repay a drug debt for his roommate Trevor. When Trevor is caught, Mike confesses, thinking the punishment will be light. It turns out the recipient of the exam answers was the dean's daughter, so the dean expels Mike from college and notifies Harvard Law of the transgressions. In the present, Harvey tells Jessica about his own coup deal with Darby and says he no longer wants the managing partnership, but Jessica rebuffs him. Harvey admits to Donna that he is bothered by her current fling with Stephen. Mike welcomes Rachel back from her Stanford interview, and promises to support her in whatever she chooses. Harvey and Mike call a bluff by Cameron and believe they have won acquittal for Ava. But Cameron still intends to go to trial since he now has the colonel as a witness, saying that Stephen "led me right to him."</p></div></div>

Jessica takes charge of the case and (against Harvey's advice) pursues the theory that Nick gave the fatal orders. Mike visits Cameron in his office, ostensibly to pursue a plea deal but actually to memorize documents to find out what Cameron has on Nick. Stephen continues to meddle in the case, and after Donna determines from the copier counter that he hid seven pages of Moriga's testimony, she breaks off their arrangement. Mike determines that Stephen was on a rugby team with the Colonel 20 years ago and personally paid him the bribe money while giving the orders for murders, without the knowledge of either Ava or Nick. Harvey beats up Stephen in the men's room. Meanwhile, Louis is reluctant to return his feline house guest to Nigel, who has returned early from Hong Kong. He challenges Nigel for custody of the cat in a mock trial before the associates, with Rachel as his "attorney". Nigel has a trick up his sleeve, bringing Harold to the mock trial to testify against Louis, but it backfires, resulting in Louis being awarded custody. On Rachel's urging, Louis accepts Nigel's offer to return supervision of the associates to Louis in exchange for the cat. A grateful Louis then informs Rachel that she has been admitted to Columbia Law School.</p></div></div>

Harvey appeals to Cameron's desire for justice as well as victory, having Mike bring in Clifford (an innocent man that Cameron had convicted for murder). Darby advises Jessica to put aside her anger, and she does, reconciling with Harvey and working with him on an ultimate solution to Ava's problem. Darby agrees to plead to obstruction of justice (getting five years' probation) and testify against Stephen. Cameron takes the surer conviction and drops charges against Ava, while Donna watches Stephen get arrested for murder. At the last moment, Darby discovers that with his probation he also loses his license to practice law in the US, therefore allowing Jessica to push for a dissolution of the merger. Back at the office, the now cat-less Louis lashes out against the associates, then goes to Harold's office to berate him about his testimony in the mock trial. Louis and Harold enter an escalating battle of legal action and intimidation, and Rachel confronts Louis over the depth of his resentment. He explains that his failure to train Harold reminds him of his own failure and the bullying he suffered. Rachel offers that Louis has bullied Harold in the same way. When Harold finally concedes the battle, Louis instead agrees to a compromise that will make Harold look good, swearing Rachel to secrecy about this unusual mercy.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Work begins on the dissolution of the Pearson Darby Specter firm. Louis convinces Jessica to let him handle the negotiations, on the grounds that Jessica and Harvey would be too emotionally involved. This backfires when Darby appoints Nigel to negotiate with Louis, as Louis (provoked by Nigel's lack of affection for the cat) shuts the door on Harvey and Jessica's plan to defeat Darby. Meanwhile, Mike asks Rachel to move in with him (to the apartment he acquired for his late grandmother), but the two begin to fight over each other's irritating habits. Louis and Katrina have a plan to increase the firm's business with Gianapoulos Holdings, which would increase their side's share of the settlement with Darby. Gianapoulos' aide is impressed with Louis' financial wits, but tells him he lacks the stature to have the proposal considered. Harvey sends Mike to ask Robert Zane to pay the Folsom Foods settlement immediately in return for a discount. Zane refuses until Mike invokes his relationship with Rachel; Zane is amused and impressed with Mike's chutzpah but Rachel is enraged when she learns of it. She tells Mike that she has been admitted to Stanford. Darby appoints Scottie as his new negotiator, with the promise of a named partnership if she wins. She pleads with Harvey to exclude the Folsom Foods settlement from the negotiations, mentioning how she helped him with the Hessington Oil case and their feelings for each other, and promising that she will not go after more money for Darby. Harvey convinces Jessica to agree to this, arguing that the whole firm will suffer from having Darby as an enemy. Soon after, it is revealed that Hessington Oil has fired the firm, and Harvey is enraged, believing that Scottie played him. Encouraged by Katrina, Louis shows his plan that was rejected by Gianapoulos' aide to Harvey, and asks him to present it. Harvey, still furious over Scottie's apparent manipulation, compliments Louis before taking him along to meet with Gianapoulos, who agrees to move his business to the Pearson Specter side of the firm. But Harvey then learns the Hessington Oil firing was in fact the work of Ava alone, as she is also suing the still-undissolved Pearson Darby Specter firm for malpractice.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Ava's attorney for her malpractice suit is Travis Tanner, whose strategy is to get Harvey to settle by attacking Scottie both personally and professionally. He gets Stephen to sign an affidavit claiming she was complicit in the murders, but Donna is able to neutralize this, visiting Stephen in prison and getting him to admit he lied, unaware that he is being recorded. Later Harvey interrupts Ava's deposition to speak with her directly, apologizing for his failings but insisting that everything he did was part of a zealous defense of her interests. She agrees to withdraw the suit. Harvey tells Scottie that he wants not only to work with her, but to have her in his life. Jessica learns of Mike and Rachel's relationship, is concerned about Robert Zane learning the firm's business, and tells Mike she will fire him unless he gets Rachel to sign an affidavit saying that she knew of Mike's fraud. Rachel visits Jessica and signs it, but asks her in return to waive the firm's "Harvard rule" so that she can apply for an associate's position on her graduation. After initially threatening to break up with her if she goes to Stanford, Mike is again supportive of Rachel, and she decides to go to Columbia in spite of her rational analysis in favor of Stanford. Louis again gets romantically involved with Sheila Sazs while attempting to lure a top Harvard Law candidate for an associate position, and he later declares he wants to be "exclusive" with Sheila. She briefly leaves Louis alone in a room which contains the records of everyone who ever attended Harvard Law School; he is surprised to find no folder on Mike.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Things get complicated when Harvey mixes business with pleasure, getting Scottie a job at the firm. Scottie has to convince Jessica to waive the half-million dollar partner's buy-in, which she thinks she does by gaining Michael Phelps as a client for the firm. Still, Harvey isn’t completely honest with Scottie. Painful memories plague Mike, as he uses a case to exorcise demons against the man who paid his grandmother a meager settlement after his parents' death. Mike and Rachel decide to move in together. Meanwhile, Donna does her best to keep Mike’s secret from Louis, who is investigating. He seems satisfied after receiving a copy of Mike's (falsified) Harvard transcript, until finding an anomaly — an A+ grade from a professor who is notorious for not handing out such grades.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Mike confesses to Louis that he falsified one A+ in Professor Gerard's Legal Ethics class, rather than telling Louis about his entire fabricated Harvard career. Louis invites Gerard (Stephen Macht) to give a lecture and says that he will expose Mike unless Mike confesses and apologizes to the professor. Harvey fails to coerce Gerard into canceling the lecture, but prevails on Louis to let it go, citing his own friendship with Louis and Mike's fitness for and love of the law. Meanwhile, Jessica's ex-husband Quentin has died, leaving Harvey and Jessica as co-executors. Quentin's second wife Lisa wants to sell his drug company, which Jessica opposes. Prompted by Harvey, she learns that Lisa's main goal is to ensure that Quentin's research leads to the release of a drug to the market. Jessica asks the buying company to guarantee this, whereupon the sale offer is withdrawn and Lisa's lawyer challenges Jessica's status as executor. Jessica cannot truthfully testify that Quentin was of sound mind when he appointed her, but she nevertheless convinces the court to uphold her status.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>As a gift to Harvey for helping him with Louis, Mike asks him to first chair a case because the opposing counsel, A. Elliot Stemple, is someone Harvey has never been able to beat. Stemple hints that he will be able to fix the case, and later confides in Harvey that he did the same in the two previous cases he won. But this is a ruse to get Harvey and Mike to bring evidence that works in favor of Stemple's client. Mike is able to find other evidence that turns the tables on Stemple and gets him to settle. Mike's celebration is short-lived, however, when Jessica says New York Lawer magazine wants to interview the man responsible for making a Fortune 500 company publicly admit wrongdoing, and she says Mike's name must be removed from the case to avoid publicity that might lead to interrogation of his status. Thus, Mike is reminded that his career will always be working in the background. Elsewhere, Scottie manipulates Jessica into giving her a case that belonged to Louis, causing a rivalry between them. Louis and Katrina are unsuccessful in trying to gain the case back, and Louis fears his standing at the firm will be affected by the appearance that Scottie was able to bully him. Ultimately feeling he is left without recourse, he goes to Harvey to cash in the favor and get Scottie to give his case back. Harvey broaches the topic with Scottie, initially framing it as a genial request, which she rebuffs. Scottie correctly guesses that it has something to do with the favor Louis did for Harvey; she demands Harvey disclose what the favor was in exchange for her cooperation. Harvey is forced to refuse, invoking his seniority and implicitly making clear that her compliance is not up for discussion. The two realize that there are times when Harvey will have to speak to Scottie as a named partner, rather than as a boyfriend.</p></div></div>

But when discussing their lives after marriage, the two find they want different things. After a meeting with Mike and Harvey, a Tony Gianapolis employee named Jonathan (Louis' client from earlier in the season) approaches Mike saying he wants out of Tony's company and plans to take his investment banking algorithm with him. Mike offers Jonathan off-the-books advice on how to get out of what appears to be an ironclad non-compete agreement, which gets him in hot water with Harvey because Gionopoulos is Harvey's client. Mike also discusses with Harvey his desire to go to law school and be legit, but Harvey says the only way that could work is if Mike attends law school away from the big cities and hangs up his shingle in a small town -- essentially knocking Mike out of "the big leagues". Jonathan gets out of his agreement with Tony and, impressed with Mike's intelligence, offers him a job that does not involve Mike being a lawyer. Meanwhile, Rachel tries to get Jessica to honor a verbal agreement Louis previously made that included then-Pearson Hardman paying Rachel's law school tuition.</p></div></div>

Harvey and Scottie appear to patch things up over the incident with Louis' case. A man named James Quelling comes up with a "bullshit claim" against Marathon Footwear, a Pearson Specter client that is supposed to go public in a week. Meanwhile Mike tells Rachel about the job offer he got from Jonathan, but doesn't tell Harvey yet. While negotiating with Quelling, Harvey learns of his gambling habit. He later beats Quelling in a high-stakes poker game, and tells his opponent he'll leave him his winnings if he agrees to drop the case. Mike informs Harvey about Jonathan's offer, and is concerned when Harvey calmly tells him he should take the job. But Harvey is actually very worked up, causing him to snap at Scottie. Quelling returns the next day after discovering the agreement Mike made with Harold to pay off witnesses in the Hessington case, and he plans to take it to the New York Bar Association the next day (which would expose Mike) unless Harvey settles for the higher amount. Charles Van Dyke, Jessica's former name partner, appears out of the blue, making claims that his dividend check should be higher and suspecting fraud in Pearson Specter's books. Jessica asks for Louis' assistance, but Katrina wants to respect Louis' wishes that she cover for him. She tries to resolve the issue with the help of Rachel. Van Dyke sees through the comeback attempt designed by Katrina and Rachel, and makes a move to strongarm Jessica. Jessica fires Katrina, but after Rachel explains the situation, Jessica appeals to Louis to help her fight Van Dyke. Mike tells Harvey he plans to leave Pearson Specter. Harvey tells Donna he wants to tell Scottie about Mike because her anger over him keeping secrets is eating him up inside. But Donna convinces Harvey that Scottie will always be angry about something. Mike returns to Harvey's office saying he has paid his hacker to make him a member of the Bar, and he now wants to stay.</p></div></div>

It seems that Woodall has got wind of the Hessington settlement, and the tenacious attorney smells blood. But as Woodall soon makes clear, he doesn’t really want Mike; it’s Harvey he’s after, and he’s willing to make a deal with his protégé in order to get him. Mike has no intention of turning on his mentor, but as he and Harvey scramble to cover their bases it becomes evident that they still have a major liability on their hands, and his name is Harold Gunderson. At the same time, news of Mike’s brush with Woodall causes the employees of Pearson Specter to take a hard look in the mirror, and they may not like what they see. Meanwhile, when Mike and Harold are arrested, Mike hopes his timid ex-colleague will toe the line. But Woodall is a man who gets what he wants at any cost, and Harold starts to crack under the pressure. Eventually, Louis convinces him not to confess. At the end of the episode, Mike tells Harvey that he took Jonathan Sidwell's job offer.</p></div></div>

It doesn't take long before the firm is sued in a $100 million class-action lawsuit for every case Mike touched. When they learn that all their client files were also stolen, the three name partners agree to go all in for the sake of the firm. In jail, Mike discovers a new enemy in Frank Gallo, an inmate who has a great deal of influence with the guards. Gallo tricks Mike into giving him Rachel's phone number, and promises trouble for Mike in his vendetta against Harvey.</p></div></div>

Donna obtained visitation rights for Rachel, but Mike gets into a fight with Gallo that leads to his visitation rights being revoked for two weeks. When Harvey visits Mike in prison as his lawyer and learns about Gallo, he reveals that he put the man behind bars for racketeering for 15 years, three times the usual sentence. Rachel keeps receiving text messages from Gallo posing as Mike and learns the situation from Harvey, who hopes Sean Cahill can help. As the cost for allowing the settlement of the class-action lawsuit to move forward, A. Elliott Stemple demands Harvey's duck painting, a clearly prized possession painted by his mother. In the midst of the firm's money problems, Jack Soloff demands his buy-in back. Jessica refuses but helps him by negotiating for his buy-in with Robert Zane's firm. Kevin earns some goodwill with Mike by opposing Gallo.</p></div></div>

Jessica forces Harvey to meet with William Sutter as a potential client; Harvey refuses to do business with a shady businessman, but Jessica demands a high-profile client for the firm's future. When Harvey tries to sign Nathan Burns instead, Sutter interferes. Louis regretfully books an office tenant to pay the bills and clashes with Stu Buzzini, head of an investment company, as soon as they move in, but Harvey makes a deal with the investor to stave off Sutter, cementing them as new neighbors and gaining Burns as a client. Now in law school, Rachel engages in a debate with a classmate and uses the skills learned from her work experience to win. Cahill offers a deal for Mike if he can get Kevin to inform on his father-in-law.</p></div></div>

Stu's traders annoy both Louis and Jessica, but Jessica regains control of the office and lands the company as a new client. Louis consults architect Tara Messer about remodeling the office to separate him from the traders and instantly falls in love with her, but Jessica forbids him from pursuing the project.

Mike tells the prison warden Harvey's plan to get him out of prison early and is warned about the dangers of gathering evidence. Mike also confronts Kevin to get him to reveal why he's in prison. Kevin tells him about a drunk driving accident which followed an argument with his wife, but does not disclose the subject of the argument.</p></div></div>

He is relieved the dream isn't true, but because of his parents' death, he isn't comfortable knowing Kevin did something similar. He continues to see counselor Julius Rowe, but Rowe isn't happy with Mike's mindset toward his imprisonment. Louis and Donna arrange a house tour with Tara but their lie is discovered. However, when Louis admits that he did so much to spend time with her, not to scam her, she is impressed and agrees to a date. In the courtroom, Harvey has taken Sutter's case, with Cahill prosecuting Sutter for insider trading. Harvey arranges a mock deposition and Kevin argues with Sutter. When Mike pursues the subject, Kevin discloses that he developed a trading program algorithm, but Sutter never used it other than as a cover. Kevin's wife, Sutter's daughter, knew about what was happening, and he doesn't want to implicate her. On the Innocence Project case, Rachel must tell her client Leonard Bailey that his execution date has been set.</p></div></div>

Harvey fails to find a guilty party among Sutter's employees, but Louis, with help from Stu's financial database, locates the banker who is the common factor in Sutter's insider trades. Just when the case seems solid, the banker cuts a separate deal with the SEC, and although Cahill agrees to honor his deal with Mike and include Kevin's wife, his superiors at the SEC back out of the deal at the last second.</p></div></div>

Jessica has a chance meeting with Jeff Malone and is interested in reviving their relationship, but Jeff is moving to Chicago and knows that Jessica cannot give up the firm to follow him. Louis has another date with Tara where he tells her that he cannot share her with another man, but despite their growing intimacy, when Tara's boyfriend decides to visit neither knows what to do. Harvey deposes Sutter's banker and establishes that he dealt only with Kevin's wife, Jill, and cannot implicate Sutter directly. Cahill indicts Jill, and when Sutter refuses to make a deal to keep her out of jail, Kevin and Jill agree to turn on Sutter in return for immunity and Mike's release. Harvey explains to Sutter that both Sutter and Kevin were his clients, and he was free to weigh their competing interests and negotiate the best possible deal.

When Harvey follows through with his promise to win parole for Gallo, Cameron Dennis intervenes, using Mike's testimony of Gallo's extortion and threats to get Kevin released as recompense. Mike delayed his own release one day in order to film Gallo threatening and attacking him in his cell. Donna helps Louis cope until Tara visits, telling him that she turned down her boyfriend's proposal in order to continue dating Louis. Meanwhile, Rachel asks Leonard's public defender to testify that she heard about his alibi, arguing that because the witness is dead this is not hearsay. The judge agrees to reopen the case on the grounds of inadequate representation and the DA offers Bailey a deal to get him released after seven more years in prison. Jessica advises him to accept, but he opts to fight for full exoneration. Together Harvey and Rachel meet Mike as he is released.</p></div></div>

Thanks to Robert Zane's warning, Harvey learns that Jim Reynolds' board is trying to remove him because of rumors that Harvey sold out Sutter to get Mike released. He goes straight to Sutter as the source of the rumors, threatening him to recant his statements. With Mike's help, Rachel and Jessica exonerate Leonard Bailey. Throughout the trial, Jessica recalls her parents separating because of her father's work, and her father's anger when she decided to go to Harvard Law rather than become a doctor. Robert Zane approaches Jessica with an offer to merge their firms. Tara tells Louis that she is pregnant by her ex-boyfriend, and he proposes to her. Stu gives notice that his company is relocating, leaving the office empty again. And although Harvey and Louis want to celebrate keeping Reynolds, Jessica recognizes that none of them have put the firm first, and informs them she is leaving.

Louis and Harvey's management starts off well, but Zane's repeated merger offer sparks Louis to drastic measures to prove his leadership ability. Mike refuses Harvey's consultant job but, when every job application he fills out asks if he is a convicted felon, he doubts his chances of finding anything. Although Father Walker offers him a substitute teacher position, when the students' parents learn of his criminal record, Mike loses even that opportunity. Louis, with Gretchen and Katrina's help, picks a fight with Zane by trying to poach associates and clients, but Katrina convinces him that he is going too far against someone who is trying to help. Harvey asks Anita Gibbs to give Mike a good review if he returns to law, earning her distaste and Mike's anger. He takes it out on Louis, proving that neither of them is ready to be managing partner. Gretchen convinces Louis to give Rachel a formal job offer and Donna tells Harvey that, with his corporate family falling apart, he needs to reconnect with his real family.</p></div></div>

Now, he reconnects with his brother’s family, but doesn’t understand why his mother blames him for leaving. His brother and Bobby remind him that he hasn’t been there to support his family. Harvey and his mother apologize to each other and she gives him a painting to replace the one he lost to Stemple. Meanwhile, Mike is suddenly offered a job at a legal clinic that recognizes his talent and appreciates his honesty. He learns he will be managing the staff. Facing hostility, Mike tells them the truth to prove he isn’t "slumming it" because he couldn’t hack it in corporate law. He helps law student Marissa with a housing case, despite the frustration of being unable to represent the client himself, and uses his own money to buy the client time. Louis steps up to manage one of Harvey’s clients in his absence. Louis and Harvey agree to be interim managing partners and leave the firm's name as Pearson Specter Litt.</p></div></div>

Rachel is derailed by a letter stating that she’s already been rejected by the bar on ethical grounds. When Harvey goes to make it right, a member of the ethics board, Craig Seidel (Michael B. Silver) insinuates that he will deny Rachel unless Harvey sues his business competitor Velocity. Louis does the research and gets Harvey the leverage to ensure support for both Rachel and Mike in front of the bar. The housing case at the legal clinic escalates, but Mike’s team members, Marissa and Oliver, seem too inexperienced to handle it. With Marissa out of town, Oliver freezing in court, Mike forbidden from acting as an attorney, and a boss who is tired of putting in overtime, Mike feels he can’t help anyone from his current position. When the judge dismisses the case, Mike agrees to Harvey’s plan. In the office, IT guy Benjamin shows Donna a device that mimics her clever quips and proposes a business partnership, but she realizes that her heart is as much a part of her as her wit and turns him down.</p></div></div>

Harvey learns that Seidel has more at stake in the Velocity lawsuit than he revealed and refuses to take his demands. While helping Mike, Harvey neglects to support Louis with the firm’s clients, so Louis brings in Rachel and Katrina; they lose a big client because of Harvey's absence, but Rachel and Katrina become friends.

Rachel and Harvey use Seidel’s situation to find a new opening, but Mike wants nothing to do with Harvey’s less-than-legal methods. Through Rachel, Mike realizes that he can’t give up being a lawyer, so he and Harvey use evidence of corporate espionage to force Velocity’s CEO into a settlement offer and reopen the deal to get Mike in front of the bar. When Donna and Benjamin meet with investors, she learns that they only respect Harvey’s name, not hers. She decides to take Stu’s offer, because he sees her as an equal. Louis worries about telling Tara that he knew Mike’s secret and used it to demand he become a name partner. Even though Rachel convinces him that telling her is better than her finding out later, Tara gets upset, Louis argues with her, and she walks out.</p></div></div>

Mike tells Harvey he still doesn’t want to work at Pearson Specter Litt when he becomes a lawyer, but discussion is curtailed when Anita Gibbs takes a seat on the board for Mike’s hearing. Donna brings Louis a patent negotiation that turns into a lawsuit against Donna’s new business. She confides to Harvey that she wants more than money, but doesn’t know what that means yet.

She uses the situation with Louis to prove to Harvey that she deserves it after all these years of being a key person in running the firm without getting credit. Harvey agrees to name her senior partner, but has to tiptoe around telling Louis. As Rachel convinces Louis that he needs closure with Tara, he allows Rachel, now a lawyer in her own right, to step up and take over the associates from him.

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Harvey and Paula agree to get to know one another better. Drawing inspiration from Jessica herself to mark the change of leadership, Harvey decides to drop her oldest client while eyeing an important client from Alex Williams, a lawyer from his past. However, Alex is only willing to transfer said client if he is made name partner at Pearson Specter Litt, which Louis and Donna oppose. Louis is terrified to lose his fragile friendship with Harvey if Alex comes to the firm, so he tries to poach the client behind Alex's back. Harvey goes to meet with Jessica to get her on his side, but the meeting results in a fight. Meanwhile, Mike's pro bono case hits a snag when the opposing lawyer uses Mike's past to prejudice the judge. Katrina tells Harvey that his promoting Donna to senior partner has changed what it means to be named a partner to those both inside and outside the firm, leading to Harvey undoing Donna's promotion. He instead names her COO while agreeing that she gets to have a vote inside the firm. Harvey also denies Alex name partner, but offers him senior partner, which Alex accepts. Jessica and Harvey make up and she confirms that he's ready to take the lead.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Louis has a nightmare about going mudding with Harvey in the other tub, only to have Alex join them and claim that he and Harvey go mudding all the time. After a discussion with his therapist, Louis agrees to try and be friends with Alex rather than possibly lose Harvey as a friend. Rachel deals with a fourth-year associate who repeatedly hands off menial procedural work to first-year employees. When Rachel confronts her, Donna steps in, undermining Rachel's authority in front of all the other associates. After an argument, both Rachel and Donna admit they have a lot to learn about their new positions in the company. Rachel concedes she needs to focus on becoming a great lawyer more than being a supervisor. Mike takes a pro bono case concerning the wrongful death of a prisoner, only to find out there's a conflict of interest because the parent company that built and runs the prison is one of Alex's clients. Mike hands the case off to Oliver, who reluctantly takes it after Mike tells him how the incident hits close to home. Elsewhere, Harvey's relationship with Dr. Agard hits a snag.</p></div></div>

As Louis finds it difficult to get over Tara, Donna tries to manage the situation. Harvey meets Jessica for help with the fiasco at work and Mike finds it difficult not to help Oliver after signing the agreement to stay away from the prison case. While Louis and Alex get on better terms, Bratton Gould is trying to poach PSL clients, as someone seems to be leaking inside information. As a solution, Harvey tries to convince Zane to agree to a fake merger. Alex proves himself to be loyal to PSL and puts himself at risk to stop Tommy Bratton from coming after PSL clients. Mike and Rachel finally decide to set a date for their wedding, but set it far enough in the future to avoid stress. Harvey learns it was Jessica who leaked the information and he understands that she did so to unite PSL in a time of crisis. Rachel and her father have a heart to heart conversation for the first time in a long while.</p></div></div>

Paula admits that she violated the terms of her professional agreement with Jacob. Donna feels that Harvey is hiding something from her. Harvey tries to get Mike’s help regarding a case and Mike’s absence makes him distressed. Holly Cromwell demands a job at PSL and Donna disagrees with Harvey’s decision.

Rachel later has to lie to Harvey to cover for where Mike is that day, making her furious. Harvey finds out anyway when Gallo calls Donna, saying Harvey and Mike had better not try to screw him again. Meanwhile, Louis is hit with a sexual harassment lawsuit from Stephanie, the fourth-year associate whom Donna fired. Katrina tries to help by visiting Stephanie as a former colleague, but it still results in Louis needing to admit guilt. Louis eventually apologizes to Stephanie, telling her about losing his chance to be a father, only to find out his rant from before hit close to home with her. Elsewhere, Harvey tells Donna about dating Paula. Donna tells him she already knew, but later admits to Rachel that she didn't know, making her question herself. A pre-trial motion for the prison case goes sour when Alex shows up in court and calls out Mike, who is sitting in the back to support Oliver, forcing Mike to admit he violated conflict of interest and causing the case to be thrown out. Harvey appears to take Alex's side in a fight with Mike, but later visits Alex and demands he tell him the truth.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>In flashbacks to the Pearson Hardman days, it's revealed how Alex arranged for himself and Harvey to get junior partner positions at Bratton Gould, following Harvey's displeasure over Hardman promoting Louis to junior partner ahead of him. Alex assures Tommy Bratton that Harvey's arrival is a "done deal," but Jessica ultimately convinces Harvey to stay, causing problems for Alex. Harvey apologizes to Alex and promises a favor if he ever needs it. Alex is given mostly grunt work and unwinnable cases for several years and his only way back is to become part of an unholy alliance between Bratton, Masterson Construction, and Reform Corp. – an alliance that Mike has just discovered in the present day. Mike tries to get Anita Gibbs to take over the Masterson case as a criminal matter, now that the civil case has been dropped, but Gibbs sees too many conflicts. Also in the past, it is revealed that Jessica was the one who insisted that Louis start seeing Dr. Lipschitz for therapy, while Donna is dumped by Mark (guest star Jay Harrington), her boyfriend of six months, when it becomes clear she will follow Harvey wherever he goes. In the present, Alex reveals all to Mike, including how his life could be in danger if Masterson is prosecuted, while Harvey reveals the same to Donna.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Harvey asks Robert Zane to take over the prison case, but Zane will only agree if Harvey lets him try the case his own way. Later, Frank Gallo dies in prison, but not before Zane could record a damning video confession from him. Harvey accuses a rep from Reform Corp. of putting a hit on Gallo. While denying involvement, the rep agrees to sign a document revealing the alliance with Tommy Bratton. Harvey uses this to get Bratton to sign a document taking full responsibility and absolving Alex of any wrongdoing. Donna reconnects with her old boyfriend Mark and is taken aback when Mark invites her to his hotel room, even though he is currently married. Elsewhere, Louis wonders why Columbia Law didn't submit any candidates for the firm. He later learns that it's because Sheila Sasz is now working in their placement department. Sheila reveals she is engaged to another man, but invites Louis to a hotel room for one last fling. While Donna backs away at Mark's door, Louis enters Sheila's room.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Feeling shame and guilt following a night of passion with Sheila, Louis throws himself into a case with his associate Brian while simultaneously avoiding an appointment with Dr. Lipschitz. When Louis finally meets with Lipschitz, he explains his actions by saying that Sheila, not Tara, is his one true love. Mike, meanwhile, suggests that Harvey reestablish his strength by taking on a prosecutor who is making waves by going after corrupt Wall Street brokers and winning every case. After finding a client to defend, Harvey learns that the prosecutor, Andy Malick (Usman Ally), once worked with him in the Manhattan DA's office. Harvey does not remember Andy, but Andy definitely remembers Harvey as being Cameron Dennis' pet employee. Donna is drawn into the case as well, being the only other person aware of the shady things that went on under Cameron's leadership. Elsewhere, Rachel goes after predatory lenders in a pro bono case with her father, later learning that the case is deeply personal for Robert.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Louis finds a way to get Donna off the hook with Malick by citing that everything she and Harvey worked on under Cameron Dennis is work product and therefore privileged information. At the pre-trial hearing, Mike and Harvey successfully prevent Malick from using that information, but Malick surprises them by questioning Donna about the documents she shredded in the Coastal Motors case. Unprepared and under oath, Donna admits to doing so, but says she acted alone and not under Harvey's direction. Donna later finds that Malick got the Coastal Motors information from Holly, but Holly will not take the stand. Mike and Harvey are able to prove that Malick manufactured evidence, offering to ignore it in exchange for Malick dropping the case against their client. Elsewhere, Rachel and Robert Zane continue their case against the bank executive who abused Robert's sister. Robert almost ruins the case by letting his emotions take over, but Rachel finds another path they can take to win the case and get the executive fired. Louis helps Alex when the other half of Bratton Gould tries to poach a huge client. Malick returns with a new angle to get back at Harvey: he intends to get Jessica disbarred for knowing about Mike's fraud and covering it up. Jessica arrives at Harvey's home and says that she is okay with the consequences. Harvey insists that he will fight for her, but she urges him to let it go and remove her name from the wall. Louis helps Donna realize that she should fight for the one she loves when he relays his own regrets over Sheila. When Harvey comes to talk to Donna, she stuns him with a kiss, apologizing and telling him she just had to know.</p></div></div>
